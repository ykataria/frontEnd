01.wav,first of all i have to warning this pot cast is for investments professionals only now you join me tucked away in our offices in canis tries in london as we career towards deadline for our latest edition of fidelity answers this time it's on the topic of risk and had to take it wisely what you are about to hear was recorded in october twenty seventeen that is just as rather than to day we wanted to look at what develop markets can learn from emerging markets hallo political risk is somethings investors in emerging markets have to take in their stride or at least prepare for the succor punch when it comes but we live in interesting times and political risk is everywhere you look in develops markets as well from an unpredictable u s president to elections in germany and britain and the yet to be determined impact of brings it or with or is it without russian interference it's enough to make your head real and it's been making some developed market currencies far more volatile than they been in the past well i'm joined by two fidelity portfolio managers a run coronal who runs yucatan and on the line from singapore is alec duffy who manages an emerging market front and oti both hallo a re note where recording this discussion in the wake and unfolding political scandal in brazil which sent shares down ten per cent within hours and the currency the round another eight per cent lower or stelling hasn't quite thrust around like that but it's still about twelve per cent weaker against the dollar than it was the day before the bracket vote last year and how significant our currency moves for you although becoming an increasingly more significant so then before breakin we weren't used to seeing currency moves of more than four or five per cent a year whereas you know about a year ago now suddenly we had a very large woman the peak the trough move of one sixty to one twenty where it was in a very large comparative or anything i'd seen before in my investing careers at something that term i definitely having to spend more time thinking about now then than i'm used to and alex presume that this is a large part of firm of your work as well yet it's integral tother to the research process and integral voler construction we come to a margin markets is is stress test in underlying good companies for changes in exogenous factors like currencies like model prices like interest rate so so it is it is a critical patty mess of process within emerging marcus they least carina and can you explain what thee and what the dangers are and your poor fellow when you see an a currency am impacts as we already described with them with sterling yes for the first thing that we we think about him that we've always thought about even prior to the larger moves this year is is really to look at the currency exposure of the portfolio so the eucharis one of the most international lockets in the world only about one third of foote profits come from the aucas we've always thought about a a portfolio exposures to the door to emerging market currencies but historically it's been more to manage exposures to emerging market currencies that that have flushed about a bit more rather than an worry about sterling which has been brought in the stable historically and and what's new for me of the last twelvemonth is really like alex has been doing on emerging markets having to think about the impact of moves in sterling on the pianer of companies and the retailers the hedging strategy is something that we've had to really focus in on and give a lot more o time to them we were used to with water had to consider or exporters and the impact that changes in sterling will have on their pricing and therefore levels of profitably so i having to her go down and talk to a colleague and emerging markets and maybe take on board some of the techniques they have been using for years alex can tell us some of those some technics was that what you do had tea do with it well i think really when i do the courage that i deal in three cool ways at a stock level on anahuac o sovereign level as well the first is really to consider the operational impact that the currency has and on the early power of business or as a roomer alluded to water the panel impacts of currency movements how do they change marge instructors on and awsome businesses profits actually being flattered by a particular currency environment actually may be susceptible to change so for that really that the first impact ice to one it is to understand the underlying cash generation and how they get impacted by by currencies the second is to have a good look at the balanced structure and and this is probably more vanish for emerging markets good often you see situations where companies will borrow in in cheap occurrences typically heroes sterling or or us dollars and then invest but that that that debt into emerge market assets and when those cash flows from the assets don't match thee that the currency in which the interest has to be paid back that can lead to severe problems record as wet when the counties move around so the really stress tests the banshees and make sure that that cash flows and effects from debts it is equally matched and then just just finally at a sovereign level it's really about understanding and what the what the risk to titucocha are as a consequence and government balances as the consequence of currency priced movement so it is the three here is that i look at what varinas emme come to you on the second point the alex made thereabout the idea of boring a one currency and but you've got em your earnings in another that that miss match is that something that the hands in the new car that is that something much more for imagine of it it's much more for emerging markets because in the u t and we've got deep and liquid a demarkation in most of the currencies the company's operate and so you have a good match between prophets and borrowing so that something we don't have to worry about an area work companies have been caught out is more on the hedging or having costs and revenues and in indifferent currencies and the best example was sport direct and who for some bizarre reason decided not to hedge sterling even though they buy all of their and products in dollars and so three days after about breakin they came out and said that an they hadn't hedged in with the pound of a fallen from one sixty two and one thirty and that they were going to have a significant decline in profits as a result and this is something that innerds that that they would have been hedging so or only sat very quickly ring round all of the other retailers and just make sure they had our sensible hedging strategies in place but most of most of them did but there were one or two exceptions and who like sports directly we hadn't thought it through us as much as they could have survey assumed a bit too much and perhaps a or investors in the eucharist also have been assuming too much as well until now yes and i think we we've just had a wake i call it that inner hedging is something that we need to be having conversations with companies about regularly wearers a year or two ago as may be just a passing comment at the end of a meeting and are these costs that against be passed on to customers and or are the companies that you lack as they had to take it up themselves a lass a really interesting question and one that sam he is going to determine you have the profit outlook for any of the retailers over the next few months so where we are to day is companies who have hedged have been covered so the heaven had to pass costs on to date and but that hedging is running out really as we speak so over the summer will find out which companies has the ability of parson that those rises to customers in which don't and i've been some interesting examples already so carpet retailers have managed to pass on the cost to customers without any problem we were in the happen already and that's really because customers don't know the price of carpet whereas food retailers are for an instance every time they raise prices it really is under scrutiny so we saw the a ere the press interest over the price of marmite a few months ago i think it manto be not more difficult are for companies where the press of their goods is highly transparent to pass that on to customers were as if pricing a bit more opaque no one really knows what a square foot of carpet cost you can probably get that through without too much trouble and analyzation the differences that remain and between the the way herter you have to look at your investments in motion markets and and the that the passions that we are seeing now and in the restored i think one of the keating that that in it that strikes us in emerge markets as more dish perhaps the more will be seen in develop mark is given would a rude allude to her indebted depth of local demarest is that really wearies of major problem is when as a balance sheet miss match and and so country such as turkey or brazil lay or in the easier we have a very high cost of local debt there is there is a real issue and when courses move aggressively that you have significant right down of equally value and and that can lead to capital raisins which a permanent loss is for for thee am fit that for the equity holders yet the penal impact is much more about the ability of the company to pass through that price in and and that comes through to the strength of the brand arm and so my experiences been if you understand the underlinen th of the brand how willing customers are to pay up for for good products from fruit from from good companies and then they tended more resilient then than other plays that operated much more competitive a competitive and finally arena you know is something his techs let a wake up call and but people are alert to it i don't know and how do you see things of anything over the next twelve months or so which should invests been young beware of ye i think that a bracket for me remains a unknown unknown i think there will be more currency volatility going forward that something i'll have to deal with and an one thing again we've learned from our imaging market colleagues is that if you do have companies with with diverse currency exposures and that aunt exposed to stirling efening the small part of their business and maybe we should pay up a bit more for that stability es i think some of the big global consumer staples companies listed in the uka and such as uneven the agio abarian tobacco i mean i maybe they should traded a bit of a premium to you no acknowledge the fact that they are global and resilient and are not really going to be buffeted about too much by sterling a changing world of changing a vestment wealth arena alex tacuba very much indeed this poncas us for investment professionals only

02.wav,this pod cast is for investment professionals only hello markets have shown their teeth somewhat better time to give the corporate world a full health check over the past few weeks over a hundred and sixty of fidelities annalist from across the globe have done just that for this year's annalist serving it's a snap shot and their assessment of how the companies and sects they cavil fair over the coming twelve months joined in the studio by three of these experts now that citadel consume it industries at credit experts one of a trim equians for industrials and not so startled equity analysts with an excited and it welcome to you all ay now we've collated reams of data provided by you and your colleagues from which a pretty optimistic pictures emerged for the next year or so which in itself seemed a little bit surprising considering the sword of damocles of a market upset was hanging over a heads fall of twenty seventeen and this year has had plenty of upsets and uncertainties already so and why the optimism it myself can i stop with you sure i think what were saying in second particular is optimi its optimism arandia ion and what that means in simple terms is turning something physical into something digital numbers based sir that could be ditto marketing the ship from partition marking to face what gogo ecumenical design you know the ship from pen and paper to three mock ups that shifted dita manufacturing and am it and collecting sense of data and besieges moving from the old old world of tidy to the new world of cantatrice has a has respited a lot of kind of spending and ender spending intentions came forward in the cool hangers in the west coast of a american what have you know what about gritty industrials or ye well is it's is quite amazing how far the world has come since maybe two years ago at beginning of twenty sixteen we were very worried about the outlook for china and we were thinking that the lights of glencore anglo might be my b m about scopas and no one was really investing in in in these very importance and markets of mining and also arden gas ever since then we have climbed all a worry and the and the corporate the oil majors the miny majors are now flush with cash flow e and are looking around the edges to deploy more of that cashew into capital equipments more comes out a minute but basil as a mood of optimism amongst your companies as well ye i think i think this is the first time in many years that we've seen sinkers global growth and it's been a volatile few years for capsule goods equipment markets a number are very depressed and with that favorable outlook for global judy pergot i think will see more investment in cap's equipments of the next years i can't get her coming to you or you radiate her an air of sunny optimism yourself and what about accompanies that you were you cover now i think for me from a spending and and looking ahead perspective most of them are pretty optimistic right now it's not to say that there aren't some some issues for example were seeing a lot of volume decline in the the consumer staples companies but am particularly in developed markets but if you look around the world you see on rising on ged piper capita in a lot of the developing world which is translating into increased consumers spending in many of these countries on your seeing people also trading up as they get higher and higher on the wealth and disease and generally speaking you see a lot of opportunities for for many companies to on tit to grow there their sails and grow there their presence in the world through the new middle classes in these countries are becoming a reality ye and i would say in the developed world ease have the positive side of as wage growth continues to take up an unemployment continues to remain low consumed confidence is relatively high you still have this retained spending am in this developed part of the world that that on we've seen foot for a little while now cay illis that's comes to point oliver rays with vickerton at basins and he good annalist words and dump some of the details emerging in this report and it shows that for the first time in five years their expectations for capital expenditure are increasing over the next twelve months in all sects and all reasons so what are they planning to spend that cash on all of em ah if i think again about the natural resources complete er we have gone through somewhat of a cape holiday for the last two three four years and the problem with that is as long as the world keeps on growing as long as population keeps on growing an energy material to monkeys were growing those capes holidays are unsustainable so i think the outlook for both oil and gas expenditure copestone cups of expenditure unwinding cathleen itur i is very favorable as we need to replenish capacity in in ortus or or the next copper mine or even replacing the trucks that we need drive round an iron or mine another strong reading or certainly something which is left out is that only one in five of the youngness that we surveyed think that the levels of leverage are going to increase over the coming years so at what was that kite i think for a number of a mornay sectors that's because leverage is already a relatively full levels and therefore overtime we can't really see them going much higher if an example so at the minute cocoa which is doubly rated has grosset to eve daw of over four times it's very difficult to see how they consist in that kind of level am and maintain their ratings on avian babe which has been on just through a massive acquisition cycle has grosteste the daw of over five times molten corps also big acquisition similar types of levels these are not levels that we would have historically considered even in the investment grade range and yet these companies are maintaining not just investment grade but very strong investment great writings despite this level so as extraordinary that in her house as tenable as that well i don't think it's that sustainable i think we can have of of the rating agencies i can have a challenge the next time we see a down turn i do osiander yes they do but these are more stable companies which will be less cyclical than perhaps some of the other names out there so you know for for some of them they may be able to manage the cycle appropriately it's a question of when the cycle turned what i thought was most interesting from the survey is that the two sectors which show thee the an stares de clerk decline in leverage over the next twelve months is the energy material sector and it should be no surprise given the increasing quality prices we've seen of the last two years but also the capital discipline that those sectors have shown and i think that feeds very nicely into the other finding of this report which is that those companies who will be swimming in fricassee the next two years will show an increasing propensity sir so begin to spend again and the cycle of captives ment and energy or materials is just about to start again mussel come to you and i mean your your companies are so flushed with cash that they and keeping it all off shore and hidden under various mattresses around the world to mean what what was likely to happen there how are they going to increase us benefit ye i think the primary impractical news as the republican tax cuts that we've seen particularly there and an answer for repatriation of off shore and funds as well as this in erection of the tax rate both of those together mean that particularly large a company such as apporo amazon these types have larger than ever now balances that can actually be deployed within the u s and in a part of that will be on by acts and dividends but the inner into spirit of what the law was meant to do it it's not all going to go back in that way and some of it is can i come back and there particularly see its way in her into efficiency capac kitten i'm of my u s staples companies i would say there seeing something very similar in that on they are expecting to on to get large amounts of offer cash back on shore and i suspect that most of that will go towards shareholders i think for the stables companies it's a little bit more difficult to deploy that capital towards capac because it's not clear what they would be spending it on where i think it will go instead from an investment point of view is more to mina rather than two capital investment as interesting and what types of em any i mean everybody's buying everybody else or spinning off everything it's if it's been the story of the last few years but effectively you have a situation with a private equity company called trig really transforming the way that we think about staples companies and am most of them are now so focussed on costs and their their margin potential on that they have been sacrificing growth over the past few years and the only way they can continue to show any level of growth is to do mina as the companies themselves get bigger the targets necessarily have to get bigger as well so you see the smaller companies are always talking about more bolt on em in a on the larger companies will talk about delivering from their last to emanate before doing something else that's big but you will see the entire garment of of acquisitions that are con to be made in this in this market but moselle eighty companies when they're ramping up their own capes as usually because they see em an unneeded for it amongst exercises a very good indicators mittie vowels care it is i mean pitcullo at the hyperspace venders such as in a gogo microscope amazon for them to run out of capacity you know would mean businesses nothing else to conduct their business any more so that great unavoidable so they need to look out two three four years and anticipate the mind in order to counterpane for their date and aromas i'm sure yet i will say them were rolling our capes defining a brutish sin for there i don't ask her to coming here but you're saying for the up to the next four yet definitely in a especially rolling out decanters in regions where he having had before that could easily take a year or two to canaries beautifully after the date center ice alienist assent to inflation on two thirds of the annas in the survey a sink higher impart cost as up from half last year and so a good indication of late cycle perhaps and wages also and set to rise especially an in china as is the beginning of firm of reflection well i think certainly a there is increasing pressure on the cross base of industrial companies you can see that if you look at the oil price steel price a copper platinum whatever whatever metal is which goes in sir cattle industrial goods we are seeing inflation and and we will see that eventually passed through to the consumer regarding wage inflation as unemployment remains remains very low round sir the developed worlds and we are beginning to see inflation in wages particularly in places like germany word union negotiations are becoming tougher and pushing for pushing for wage increases more strongly ketchin to you because a york if if the stars begin to to take hold and are your companies going to absorb that because the margins are so to press at the man when they will have to pass it on so i think you have to split up a lot of the consumer goods world into two parts of one is the gods who actually produce food beverage staples those kinds of things and the second group are the retailers who have to sell those on i think what we are finding increasingly is that these tables companies are still getting through their price inflation but perhaps clothing company were demanded structurally a lower are not getting through quite so much of their inflation and the retailers are certainly struggling on especially in in a certain development tion and retail remains very high both from on a brick and mortar competitors and from all mine competitors of those retailers are really struggling to pass on a price increases to two customers so i think we are seeing the same tensions it's just in a slightly different on place and the question is whether it passes through ah to to some of the gods who haven't experienced it so far yes you know him there in the jackwell to think we seeing certainly in put prices going up to dear emprises spiking a pretty much across the gorge what we also seeing his constellation wage in faction shall i say rising materially to am in a lot of that compton the form stock based calm asked of his compensation but even to space wages particularly to back of tolliver said in germany arising not as for you the top rock stye the experts but even all the way down to university graduates and i definitely seen wage in fashion so he could right well thanks you will for share your insight from the sects you cover on a remarkably uberto isabel oliver trimming in moses

03.wav,this pod cast is for investment professionals only hallo in early march camp china a giant state owned chemicals company one of the largest industrial creek in china offered a jumbo sized bond issuance worth over six billion dollars the largest corporate bonsal by an agent issues so farther here that was this tantalizing investment or risk to be avoided on the surface at least kachins environmental social and government credentials are enough to put the fear of god into even a hardened investor accompany handles millions of tons of toxic discharge every year it employs a hundred and sixty thousand staff to make him handle those chemicals and has to navigate tight regulation in a number of territories not least its home in turf enough to put you off well with me to day to explain why they weren't discouraged by that litany of dangers and to help us understand it better about how ye s g considerations really work in the investment colfax are here in london might durand direct of research on the line from shanghai avenging cried annalist and in hongkong brian collins fixed in campoodie manager work and you all the brain i'll start with you as you're the person who ultimately made the decision to incorporate the cachinnations in your portfolio and am broadly i s s g even a possible consideration am in china it's not something that leaps to at the forefront of my mind but that's tapers my ignorance you will eat steers still a relatively new concert for a lot of issues and invests for that matter actually in this part of the world but it's its interest and i suppose the arm insuring that it's a fact affair for a lot of invested is increasing rapidly in issue as are responding to it amine to some extent that for this particular issue of cinchona you don't immediately think about that missus a sty champion but it's one whereby the concept of est investing in china sex starting to become much much more relevant onoway saying a significant investment from chinese authorities not just chinese but indian and other regional powers in environmental remedial so that could be a relating to a renewal energy it could be environment or remedios for water treatment for example and so a singular more indes opportunities come up in that space a lot of companies in this part of the world will have a strong level of government ownership particularly in china so the state one enterprises and often they're going to not only be providing the service that they are but the gong to be employing a lotter people so there is an element of the service that they have to the country to keep people employed to this very much that aspect and then from a governante perspective we're talking about govern own organizations and we're talking about those whereby leveridge is highly err in focus at the moment except excessive leverage and clearly companies have to be doing something if their government owned that are in the national interest so these themes are strong there getting stronger and that's relevant here in camphire case for some extent but more broadly within a sea a lot more of it in the years to come so very relevant am across the borg in china and albano to you in shanghai or the expert even following can china for i am a wireless er as an analyst how does este play in to accompany like this brine described it chinoise owned at huge so it is becoming a much more alive if she is all right and is she a thing is reminded in you in china there think company especially as etheling a leading role and ensuring their doing good on the s g especially and also yes you will impacted business oppression as well so if you have noticed that the recent have talks from the china to political leaders have in pleasing more and more focus on environment of issues in china so the company as big as can china if they vavasor continent emissions than that is highly likely that oppression will be suspended by governments for that excessive mission so they have to make sure the environment of social and gameness up to tender require but assassin so i think that's also related to to the omans return of the company and the fumble of buffoons of the condemned as well and how do you engage with cam shine on on these topics the interesting thing is at catana is one of the first batch of copy they kind of for continue to release a sustainable report on the westcote when they continued to have the report as early as twenty eleven and now they have like each year welhaven the report did go on with the keno efforts on east an on a difference a part of the e s and g and also we will also do some on back on check on help company whether they have kind of em since can those on governments yes so that's probably the things i do on him china when checking the yes yes eye and is it becoming am more of a lives you for you as if some this is becoming a more important a factor when you were considering companies it's always been a part of the research work has mentioned because the environment to issue the social tone governs is kenneth opening result but i do have the feeling that the most are especially from the europe getting more and more and requirement on specific years to reclining on these companies or young intentionally picking would he more attention to the steepest companies so instead of it i am being driven by the investment performance aspect which is what you you talk about an originally that there's a more explicit requirements that i'm if you've has got to lay out various things at the request of investors yes i guessed his countries been on something of her a buying spree and perhaps why it needs to it to raise this at this cash it bought companies like purely the thawing time are its sport as engender and agrican cal's company also here with me in london is my doin dirt of research and a you you met the company when it was on the london leg of its ratio and a trying to drum up interest in the intestine what were the discussions like when you took to him yet that's correct sir they reached in asia first of all then they came to er to europe and the u s and i met the mother in london they were issuing bird bonds in dollars and heroes so there was a wide investor appeal hence they did there the global road show in at my angle i guess is that i followed singen for a number of years and since enter itself will be issuing bonds later this year so i wanted to get a better understanding of how kem china was going to look after this in gen to business eyes convince great discontent to business and utterly how it was gone a finance testiness when it comes to the market later this year yes jean bring it back to that had that playday did they present an amnesty aspect unto thee to the company when they when they came to tot they didn't formerly present your sheep but some as alvin's already alluded to yes she is imbedded in our research process here fidelity and has been for a long time we've always focused on governance where is appropriately focussed on the environmental angle and the social angle as well and now it just seems to be in outside this is new invoke rapper ye cheat we've always focussed on that and is embedded in her process i know i think saint john is a good acquisition for cam china from an ear steppers petie in a china has a twenty per cent of the world's population but only around eight per cent of the world's arable lands has a huge challenge in feeding its people so as a social angle there and is also an environmental angle and saint gentes that suite of acacia a seeds end and crop science will definitely help him in that process and so that rats the whole all three of the men whole sweet boy both of you even is well you gather this information and then and the process is that you am presented back to and the team here at fidelity so and to touch me through that as it was just an a branchless and utenhove and the pans put funny managers i am here in london as well ye ministers as he knows i say we are in it we we weep we do our credit work we present their back to the team but yes she is part of that credit work at some pavilion managers are more focus on that than others and but it's it's definitely a very important part of our process so what are the sorts of questions at your fielding around us you know what what is it sir what is its governance like water the sward of the social angles is it doing damage to the environment at those kind of questions alvin you'll pose this traces as well what are some of the questions that you get from our p ms not just bryan of course in an oconee and the ropemakers dotted around the world but that what are the questions are firing at you around about a company like enchain i think that general question as my lies also kind of for discovereth comment does onest and then i read the things that lay i do as a real try to come together as in as much as intuition i can one company armed on the annunciata as indiana do some research on how how things are kind of a manager i contrived an the i think a parame company a date company office actually there is some kind of independent research on howcome the doing against his peers like umboo there's actually appear compact comparison or how much emission and aravaipa per unit revenue is for ketchin how did it compare to appear in the clean a check that came to rectitude and compared his dull capper so i can liken come back to him saying that on the mision side company is actually doing elizabeth better than piers i think it's above ravaged e i'll give him a bridge eastboro that's an example how we communicated with appealing along through the respect of the year's in g and at how much do you have to burrow down how much an engagement you have to have with the company and to answer some of the more probing questions from pompions offing for all these chinese company on the estimates also quite convene for them so it's quite unusual awaitin to accompany concertina yes again you can imagine that the copy will only give you good information on yesterday that perfectly indigoes up to our alice's kindest responsibility to discover is that anything of any real light in terms of years young and over what would the more interesting things that you manage to find out what is interesting and final exactly the company as i consait that the day were attempting is also one of the big makers of ties in china and they think of ties as kind a tide to the few consumption by cars and then naturally happened improving the technology entire too kind of time to improve efficiency of view and that can indirectly improve like that is reduced a few consumption help to relieve the romans so i think ye're so living there are kind of small parts of the copy and actually at doing something good in the violence so that's the reason final reason that actually we are rejoined he recommended are kamchatka kind of fat yes you comply bryan i'm coming to you as one of the the pens at making home a judgment called on whether to put money in or not how did you reach your your conclusion i'm around cocoa because of the jumbo deal nature it meant that the initial pricing for this particular deal was going to be attractive and this is also one which had been worked or submit only communicated with the invest basin we had met them in her in asia and in in london as mentioned before so there was a time in here where we could actually put together our orders and actually get an excellent allocation in what otherwise is going to be an attractively priced investment grade chinese state and enterprise so that class the fact that we had multiple points along the curve multiple dolban a riband as well meant that it was a wide widely appealing that's really what drove it for me to put into a couple of different portfolios the fact that we had fundamentally a high quality chinese essay making a large gale high profile over seas acquisition with all the benefits that we talked about in terms of bringing that technology home to china and also allowing china to move up the valley chain so this is a strategically important series of acquisitions for kim china and so from a fundamental perspective we have a very strong foundation the valuations were clearly cheap and in terms of being how to get the kind of spreads that were on offer for what is a as low a in amid the high triple be kind of credit very solid went on talking about something that's high yield here so if you can get a high one hundred stead of low two hundred kind of spread across multiple points along the curve this is extremely attractive from an investment grade for fallen managers perspective the biggest sort of drawback in the near term is really the technical factors because it's such a big deal across multiple trenches it needs to be priced and it could mean that at such a big deal trades weak on the break and so we do need to be sensitive about some of these more tetanic aspect so how the book was built and the book built and all the other indications that the trading tam provided back to all of us was extremely strong and gave us a lot of confidence as well as part of that process the ears thief actors of it here are important we want to make sure that which direction is this company heading towards is it looking to make increment improvements in these factors or is it going the other way and clearly we don't want to be having these sorts of factors risk the investment profile going forward so knowing that they have been looked at that the annalists in alvan have done some digging and that we know that there is some general improvements on that front just further supports the investment case a brian how important is it that am we're doing this research i am ourselves that people at alvin and mica are asking these tough questions it's important in a couple of different ways and one is that you know as affirm we certainly use and some of external provides such as sir as mentioned by avenel to look at information about one blumberg or to use other external providers like sustain aliis however that the cabbage there is is not complete there certainly large parts of the investment universe that we look at especially when you come into e m and especially when you come into some of the parts of asia like china like keshia were simply you don't have this third party assessment about easter this now third paddy score so fall intensive purposes we've got to ingrain that into our research as we always have as part of that assessment the great thing about having these external providers is that it provides an external bench market helps you get there faster but we want to make sure that we we bring that in purely because that's our valued that's our belly wad as bottomed researches we can bring it in when there's no other external source severest greases the other thing that's important hurons is a bit longer turn at something that as affirm we have done for quite some time that i think we're going to have to do more of it and that's really about engagement so if for example when we're having these conversations with companies like him china like others and were asking them more more about these e e s and g dynamics we can actually stop to help our through engagements actually effecting some possible improvements increment perhaps but none the less if were asking these questions if worth trying to see what management are doing to improve on these various metrics than that ultimately can also be positive just through the sheer active engagement and as active investors alvin yon nodding enthusiastically ye tell just what a changing here as bryan brightly put out anything the coverage for the yeos icily accompanied in china from actual reports on essayed so as a result that he was starting to develop us separate project to folkstone a scoring system for these company s g especially for the coffee like of lacaita if in china the current to the mount of what years g score probably is limited but we can see a growing demand for that kind of comment lightly we are devoting sort of like a kind of question ist or can questioned sheet for copies ugly we are trying to score a acoma on thus sepastian and that scouts be different from the exes of provides like blue begins assisting lettis and we hoped as corvisart remote more reliable and more kind of more just more justice reflection of the alcomotive on the yesterday a structured approach to help build that picture yes exactly for just one final point from me ready ryans comments around changing behaviour is crucial i think you know where fidelity wave always focussed on that from a government's prospective we always look to to get companies to behave better from a governor's perspective why can't we do that on the environmental side and the social side as well can we i think we can and i don't think sir we've met with an investor this year that hasn't wanted to discuss seistan what we're doing on us g and how important he as she is to our process absolutely greater cameo like sterne direct research thank you very much in shanghai thanks to avenging acred analyst and in hongkong to brian collins or ferny mancher decker i hope you

04.wav,hello i'm richard edgar and this poncas is for investments professionals only here why should i reconsider my avocation to asia that's the question fidelity answers in this port house we explore the very latest in the investment world nation challenge some received wisdom and find out who was putting money were in the region might not be what you expect i am joined here in our home come studio by two investment directors and experts on the reason which furnished from fixed income and barrymore who covers equites welcome to you both now were recording this just after the announcement of which chinese maman listed stocks had to be included in the emesa flagship emerging markets index as a bench mock for over a trillion and a half dollars worth of assets carry is this a game changer for the region as well as to china it is in that chinese main land shares can no longer be ignored an i think it's fair to say that if we if we consider where vests have been putting their money in the last well for last ten years or even longer than that been very easy to ignore the mainland and because is not in the index suddenly they moved into the index and you can no longer ignore it so in that sense definitely it is a game changer and what it also means for for acid manufacturers even like the lakes of fidelity is that if you haven't already been looking at ayesha's ye you can have to stop doing that and it's not an easy task and the company's men generally report in mandarin and they the company reports will be written in mandarins wealth he you need to get your annalists in placed in order to do that in this is not an easy task well i'm sure you've been brushing up your own mandarin at garry but nobody's denying that is one of thee with the greatest hurdles to investing in in china is that the companies are of course reporting in their own native tongue so you got the old to master had had had a week at with it and quite simply there's no substitute having people on the ground and so we call annalists hearing in hong kong singapore a shanghai as wahoo speak the language and and go meet the company's face to face not like m in the fixing camels he must be fed up with the attention that your recites colleagues are getting and with a less emesa a share in ex excitement that and is there a halo effect of raising the profile of investing in the region in all assessed as a result of all this while we tell the maternal warsaw a little revolution going on i should hear a few weeks ago e lumber barges index announced that there was going to include china on showing their own index so this is causing a little real revolution in our bellmark dew as garry mentioned isis defeat attracting more attention toward the on shore market in china at the inclusion is going to lead a lot of the bench mark for the world which is a large amount of for introduction al money he directed a bit more attention toward the untracked so we are taking about five per cents in the sarrebourg or his index papeetee on shore it's not very large if you can pay this due the size of the china on trouble mark atrides about twelve treated you as do it's it's a drop but it's a beginning and allow alkalis add to that what what we've seen in the last twelve months is equities have done a vigilant ing job in terms of talking bout missa including a shares and when we are my clients the questions are always directed towards the act warden it seems to me that is often sylvia not ignored but not well known that this happening in in the affixing constance as well and that's something which i think is quite important consist not just equity money coming into the mainland but for fixing her money as well witches probably on on on the whole a big wall of cash how are the clients changing who is putting money into into china as is that changing look on thee fixing come sides i look at the bean marquette's steed in main player or stealthy in the institutional money if you look at the overall china untroubled over all we have about listen two per cent of foreign on a ship and she look at the composition of this ownership is mostly institutional client like central bank sovereign well found the retailing vestal shoe combat later on the message hasn't reached that fire yet or is it confidence a lack of confidence it's simply a diver stage of development of the market he would bicycle first the institutional going when he going down they have more resources to to analyze the mark at and followed that speed returning festal is exactly the same ready for the equity space and that the key unlocked the asia market for four invests with stock necked that is really something that institutions can can use and and it's not that easy for the retail the reekie to do that unless he they invest in companies like ourselves and thinking about the questions that and these clients in station clients and are asking you both however they changed and over the past couple of years much more receptive i think too to austen before it is very easy too to ignore because there was never in the bench mark also you could pretty much say oh you know we don't know that companies very well as cooper governante issues in the nattiest ignore the entire market but i forget that the market itself if you look at shanghai and changin there they got a market cap of about seven and half trillion compare that titucocha sixteen eight tricasse as to the main end is that shed bigger market in japan and clans ignore is you can't signore it but the people were because because of the point that they would were not in the index we see her a similar de romano the fixing coincide aben in age for the past seven years and what we say is like we are entering the desert face the first face was going to you rob meeting some international investor and the question was why why would i put my money in ease are specifically in chile a few years after that the question was actually an you can give me a positive argument for metres in inn in again china because they wanted to convince also there in this man bought to start putting money in china in asia and now we entering the substation the so stage is how how do i do that or garry let some took a little bit more detail but the missing eyes about to push huge companies some still unknown abroad on to the world stage what impact is that going to have on their business while first will you you should see more so that they say foreign institutional investors on on the shareholder register which in a caning of more questions so ye tetigit may be a little but more active his type investors and particular greater folks than i g which is united a key theme at the moment and something that argentines perhaps until now have not had to concern themselves with has not so much a menials a groan thing globule onyway so so is if it should come as a surprise to any company but am at as you get more in stationing vests on asa said on the should of register do you expect to see a lot more focus on est corporal governante am and just general question around there he nomasaba going over the business in the direction of his heading in what they going to do with the money that this investment represents were hopefully the good companies will get there to the greater a great centre of the cash that comes in particularly if you think his ass is an active manager we can choose the businesses that we that we invested so hope for the best of companies get more more cash which they can them re invest in the business i hopefully greater rate of return one of for thee to command that i frequently hear from internationalist when i tell them he'd look at this mark at his growing so fast i often hear what that instead the company are despising up more debts so it is actually from a respite of view this is not the good thing it's actually not really the case it's also as does the stage of evolution of this company most of the company in asia in fortiguerra thana have been extremely reliant on the banking system so we be using laws to finance their working capital or the expansion now if you see im if you continue evolving becoming more sophisticated needs a large amount of capital which benilo provide you you need to go on the capital market the other thing is that the most sophisticated you become the more diverse wants us or founding to be to that also much edition for this companion into the ancient usborne market or international market so it's not necessarily the same company issuing more that is actually more company and we see that every man you have made an sure a new name coming on the market it requires a lot of firm research power but at the same time that's significantly increasing the diversification put in charlie in our space save every thinking about the they said away from the very meercat companies in the asia market do you see them starting to use fixing her market because on assuming a lot of the smaller companies they really have much experience there ye away see that happen more an more do you think the challenge that this companion have at the moment's ease is twofold firstly for a small accompanied them to be higher rise on the high space and in china on shore there is not yet a hian market was of the high your company that you would find our actually fallen entre that's the first thing the sign thing is that at the moment if you see this le name trying to issue on the year used a labe locket they would have to pay her that will be so high just you make sure make the offer palatable that you would not make sense for them so it it is going to take tom for the small guise to come on this market careening active management but i wonder whether conclusion in an index and heralds the decline of of active and china because am now investors can pop their cash in a fund that are the tracks that index get the exposure get the diversification for example and that the china offers and but and they can do it very cheaply first of all these we have to remember the inclusion at the moment is at what they call fierce inclusion rates so effectively there the capping the size of the chinese stocks to any five into the true size and is only two hundred thirty four that were moving into the index out of several thousand if there is about fort to about forty four and half thousand lastic companies and to be frank a big chunk of those are ready to be universal form invests like a selfish liquidity constraints in such but but there is a lot of companies which are not in the index for a start so active managers can beyond the the boundaries of the index which it creates alpha hopefully if you get your stock all right this is actually another question that i frequently get these i would have us active management to invest in market like jana entre and all on very open about to the the use of a passive in this man in certain markets high led the blow efficient market he can make a lot of sense especially as a compliment unity tragedy now if she look at thee specifically chinatown market one of the big change of east to properly assess the great risk of his shares so you know that on shore they have a different greeting system the local reaching agency only used three readings the triple adobe and singly and if it be it's only a volatile recent trench where you see a differentiation in the crazy spread of the different reading group so let the challenge if you are an international in this door and you try to follow this reading is that you especially if you do battye you're just going to in this randomly and you don't know who sate creditor we are going to this the spell of which is going to widen and the wonder though going to titan so it is really a market where active management makes a lot of a much less diversification in terms of the official writing but your point is that there is diversification am in the reality of her how companies are be managed on the risk they represent absolutely that it is a normal mocket but dirt the reading daunts necessarily reflect this reality if you're investing with active management you can you can choose the company managements you believe are working on your behalf as a shareholder so i forget that i view are investing in passive particular china where there's a great deal of essares you your embracing certain risks that may be that you're not aware of and particularly if if a large chunk of your passive market is estate and enterprise you are are investing in companies where you don't reave a say in what's going on and that unmanning is generally the sake government driven somewhat and that they can court be called upon to do national service and sometimes that leads to poor capital allocation and otes thee the company is being an asked or told to behave in a way that suits the country rather than show is exactly so i could be a statia and luke may be coming up with the best new idea we've ever seen but you happen to be an industry that employs two million people and and the government may say to me we've got five hundred million dollars you've got to give it to richard because her late their keeping two hundred two million people employed were as really from thinking from a shareholder perspective and of future growth i should be given that money to luke and and then he can creep incredible returns and announced the industry of the future so so without ready realizing it sometimes impassive you are you're your pup putting money to to company's wear i cud said you don't have the greatest control and there can be some miss allocation castle and what about the governance in an in normal companies that the heaven normal structure and all one that were more familiar with the hats and the state and enterprises and what about the a management priorities there it is as different as there a development that is yet to happen in in some of those companies so that one thing men people talk about china nicest as try for asia she is not just to china story and people say our cotrone is poor i think that we will have to think about what what we mean by that actually quite often particular when you're meeting companies that are not to make a cap who worded experience and that the company will be owned majority by the founder and a couple of his friends next say and they've never re had to deal with shareholders before so it's not that there their cowboys and are there you know again run off with your money inebriate fortunate accounting as not true at all is just that they haven't had to deal with the the the expectations of shareholders and and that can be seen as not bad corporate governance is just inexperienced corpora governments so had we engaged them with with companies like that and that a large part of what fidelity and investments officials talk about and excelling so what water the conversations like there's no other substitute her having a feat on the ground and going talketh and whether that's through the analysts and the portales team or quite often for our equity capital markets team who whose role is to and whose rollers carper engagement to to discuss some the things that we that we hold dear she resaddled from m our investment perspective and and discuss things that we will vote on them and and talk about those issues that's a very important point and it's something that sometimes missive interpreted outside of isa is effective you do guards large even small asian companies the ownership is usually more concentrated so as is usual to have the under ways the chairman was deserted deceive there is nothing really wrong about it but to some extent he also explained the explosion of the bemocked in in asia if you look at er buckin two dozen and then when deed bank erbin bank started pulling out of asia we saw a lot of this issue of coming on the market the effectuate changed them intimate show more to tom to issue to industrie should have borne any one to get it treated you need to discourse quite of feinting like when you le stir at the company and the desire help or sold to improve the gondolas of the company that tended the wicker so these are still emerging and that this is some that this was the some way to go still but a lot of a lot aflame has already happened with you yea oh oh just be careful wise that them emerging because a it's slightly a different oblique boots at one of the thing that i usually struggle with it so with in this ordeal not necessary familiar with thee the asian space is as i get put in the same bucket as emerging mocket and then it least also be bold to say all shall so expensive bogota gets much better yield misbehaved think you're not comparing up always apple the reality when you invest of i'm going to focus under the fitting consider the realities when you inverse in the as are universe in tabards sixteen front markets and some of them are very devoted some of them are highly deblois you look get countries like are like hoole singapore the eve they are the very high level of development if you look out the the ginevra capital of singapore is actually higher than the genio capital from from germany so is he my point is that it's it's a limit dangerous he took a boat emerging because we are talking of a good mix between develop and emerging you make a ready interesting point because people are beginning to shift from emerging market debt two eight of a precisely the sort of reason that you you change the risk profile and there is a diversification away from other denmark ets but you are lowering the risk perhaps an a that goes alongside that on if we are learning the risk you if i think that there is more awareness for what is as to affirm obtusely when people were looking at ajar they were mostly looking at the yield that he can get by this cheese for yield and i think you leave you load said the d the investment that you can make in the bone in asia you would get a much higher yield than you get in europe you would get the similia that you gets in in in the usual duration it's a very attractive proposition just in damaris profile then people also starts with king adds the different sectors again investing to we took in about e the folks on the agent used double market it's sam it's a mocket that has grown by about twenty per cents on the annual visits every year of the bastards and this was led or souter emergence of new sectors a few years ago if he wanted two beds on the consumption or gaming you will have won two names now you are oval sector to what people are seen is it's not only about yield is about dirtying the potful you into difference industrial and the types of outcomes that people are looking for and has moved on as well garry and it the asia is just about growth ere now meant hat there are other factors that that we seize being quite interesting within the region for example dividend i then he often shocks people to to think of asia is a dividend market but if you don't give you look in markets like highland where the the old carnes are on two pots even per cent tyin wotes about three and a half per cent and we we've got markets and his luke would have said this diversification but we've got markets to offer different things for it for different types of investors and an end that she summon was saying to me yesterday that the that they read study that one of the key drivers for sheer price or of return and chair prisca tal growth is is an increased dividend within the asia region and since telling you that there are other factors other than growth and but of course to grow your dividends you ye generally have to grow your yea grow your business and grow your car grow your cash fly and salute so is linked but but there are other factors were pitiful interesting alike when er investors put their money into agent fixing and what exactly is it that termed that thereby one point that we touch his desire good mix with balance between diplomat and emerge market that's a i couldn't stressing of this sir at this point sooner and beside this what they were so fine is the reciprocation lower coalition was on the market we started talking about the channel on troublemaker again lot of people are looking at this mocket because it offers lightly higher ye dan than other market but for my point of view what is the mean benefits especially in the market where a lot of people took about stretch valuation or scared about voracity what call our entry is providing you with is a user glass which has close to zero coalition with all their saises sure you tell me what is better in your pot for you in the mother pacification so i think this is this is wed want's institutional in this or are more and more looking for they go beyond the yield and look up the diversification precentor think apart from that on a whole a big picture type of view buying asia in particular equity market his divine future though i think about it that the new businesses of developing in the region which he in i don't exist in your ain in the world ten cent is a great example by the this is a a platform ere the width through their wheat out platform has multiplied her functions that don't really exist in the west and western companies were looking and so well we could do that and since so we you are in your investing in the future riveting the future growth as well so artistic throughout some state he never got four point five million people in a region which is about sixty per cent of the globe of population thirty five per cent of the global judy p and yet that is growing fast in most places in the world so your looking at places at indonesia five per cent plus or genie perote china six and six and a half per cent indies around seein growth so that that thirty five per cent of g p which should grow overtime if we we continue to see leave the contradictory which we don't we don't think it was the one reason to see a change in europe of the faith of man we do expect am energy pea to continue growing at the rate of we've been seeing it somewhat yet at the same point in time asia ex japan is only four and half per cent of the globular equalizes an enormous miss mattie notes the same enter and fixing him as well that they and the proportions of that allocated to asia are homage smaller than that they ought to be on that turn on that measure the bow perhaps reasons for that though and what we were coming to the end and so am after an inspiring discussion perhaps one that the good reasons for out protesting ate what are the things that invests me to watch out for them what are the potential downside and because he conscious plough in good deed did the traditional risk that he is seen in mockeries kanaka is the theoretic this is depicted what people would tell you as even a bird of a uncertainty you going to receive much high volatility on emerging mocket including asia it actually not been the case if we guard some i go back to to de break seats and reverend and boards all the travellin what we've seen actually is that asian used the law on market especially on the englishman greenside i've been a safe even because you are you are evil to shift money into event whose pretty well sheltered from the rest of the world and where your opportunity cost our action not that said that high at all it's an amazing turn of lensky in his end end alongside their increase volatility i must say that there is there is generally great red or participation in some of some markets with which dost scraper churn and so therefore we can you can be on the wrong side of that so that there's an element of risk there and but also one of the things which are mentioned earlier as a lot of state and enterprises in in the region an hour a big chunk of the market and if you are passive investor in particular you you are taking on the state and enterprise risk which is you don't always know what's happening with the capitals that the company has so so there are elements of risk that you have to be aware of and so therefore go back to the point of why active that's the blast the key on the keys of settling protracted in the regions you try and avoid those those areas and particularly not all lessees to bad thus the woman on to say that but and there it there is a risk of captains allocation so alick sir we going to hear probably over the next few months if not years about more defaulting in child this is already making the headlines of older almost of the the national newspaper the reality the way we seed from on the ground is its opposite devotement it's a positive of the roman in the sense that it improved a capital location the bad issued bad company who are pining that were artists doing him an aid inconsiderately legal all going to be sanctioned the government is going to see stepping away and say luke in the store you need to realize the restarting so it is beneficial for bors companies because he helped them allocate capitan property if your good company you should give less fain and is good for in this stock because now when you put your money in the company you know that you're going to be compensated for the westacre taking so they am a more efficient markedly that there is maturing and am that brings caperings with it benefits there am i'm one of the rest to think about as well as that you are taking on institutional risk and and by that i mean that you still seeing some developments in develop within regulatory environment ah even it could even be some legal fields and in some cases and governments and tynan is a great example where a weant see some elections of first selections for a number of years next year say there are those risks as well that you are embracing when you look in the region and but again ejus need to be very selective it plenty of opportunity but go in with your eyes open and perhaps the best way to tooit at all let me thank you

05.wav,hello and welcome to the july edition of rich pickings for denis's as education hoast i'm a rivederci that is her in chief in to day i'm in the garden just outside for denis's cannon street office a small oasis in the city of london and if you're looking for wasis then you've come to the right place for we have an unadulterated sanctuary of thought and investment reflection in this month hotels is i asked it avocation to him take stock ahead of the summer break hard to read market sentiment great in the system i am afraid wars are all discussed rich pickings indeed joining me in the studio are three of the metai in festival welcome too short harrington markus aniline so that this month i want to know what is the one thing you wish you had known at twenty one i think i wish that i had known how valuable it would have been to know a second language beyond english yes and and which language i am chinese and why cause it so will be and is increasingly widely spoken absolutely it came well and also he was portending bilma quaker now what would you tell your twenty one year old self i i wish i'd known that scott would only appear in the work up once or twice more in my life and that that i should enjoy it well at last i've just to explain what recording this am very shortly after england's disappointing exit from rather further along in the join the work happen of light and welcome back and anna stupids global economist and ukrainian fan i imagine em an dey've been away for some months at what hot tip would you give your younger self i think that i wish i had known that the value of time only rises over the years a hot abeam really precious and you don't know that this is the case when you're young an investment indeed too at to save it when you have its rights were thank you all for being here and damanarkist orts with you for may and the annotations this month has anything changed as the group changed its positions at all nothing has changed to we had the a long discussion about towards her we want to do but we decided to be a toaster neutral inequities and wafted income and all with cush and and it seems that sir right now there is not much appetite to add or in fact to take risk of the table i so decided to keep the continuation a cape well m on that theme of rescues sir i've been talking to somebody else about this cause our regular lessons may have noticed that we're missing one of our storrs are the chief investment officer with the multitude james bateman is travelling this week but i managed to cash up with him a little bit earlier about what he thinks is driving sentiment all the well gondolieri heard them even to the convent idea honored by half the intrepidity at the moment in market in that we know again that comely volume period we know the typically a renewal importance can be implied by that are a volume and we know a commodity we know that the data it doffing or bateato of estein but moderating not to be made to blow down we all to know that later by occasion between the europe and erect the world about detonite stronger but he back could forget either in a way or auto hear that by challenge very clearly that they had been driven by by the anglican general arm and that narrow of the market in their additionally when we think about me and the dried market overcoming on a thumb point a period of rick aversion but lightly from his dipping up his rhetoric on on a trade war any dipping up his action and their prodigal further atalantis and what our medium turn out looked that they will bear only made by a large teacup in the shorter term that ready good way or market and and particularly pacificator the area eidothea be carpeted so the battered the river limited being overweight equity at the moment but a very one or by on any he any actual weakness that come through arm over that from period and again by bad law bumping at a reasonable count that we will move back to an great position in equity contact ober time an assuming marked again the bed over the pummeloe your name out of it on that was jane baton speaking to me a little bit i'm earlier i'm anna essentially this is a repeat of as something he said a little while ago which was a sullen may and go away while looking at him the a maceda et least to oh we see that era the fundamentals are not deserting very fast but and not accelerating either and this has been the case as indicated by our leading indicator and now for a few months and so it's it's not is not very different we think the data is probably finding some floor right now on the gobble basis ah but it's hard to have a very strong conviction either way so shall it you you're not particularly concerned them if further fundamentals seem to sit as settles where they are at the moment i don't think the fundamentals has settled where there are the moment i think we've had one month of sideways m after several months of decline and and if obese smooth that data as is i think we do and most of all models on and so on am actually the the director travel for great at the moment is still lower e james didet ada that the west stands out as having held up much better than ever or else smithing that becomes a crystal question for us going forward as can the west maintain that strength given the rest of world weakness and i think even there we're starting to see perhaps some very very early and a linen had too hard to ready make a big call on it but some very early signs that business is new s are particularly concerned about trade and there are some secotan within within the market that is they come to chase in a minute that let me bring anne boleyn what where are you and all this in his oration er poor fido of course are you a waiting and seeing a through the summer at fore for her position what savon comes back after semolina well at my my stance moment is a on the defensive site in the round arm i'm a bit more cautious on equidistant on macaulay's am and a bit more rare bits towards the the bon market explain why am i think care anna trot about the lead indicators in sliding gruff and that certainly been important for me or other developments higher or prices higher interest reads am stronger dollar these are conventionally a quite challenging eases for markets and in encouraged one to the air in the sadau ah asoudee that changing make as you see us getting through the next couple a month i i think there is a arrestive to charlotte's point that the state theories arm and having up unwelcome for marcus thus also they say this boding narrative around tree that's not particularly helpful the the silver lining a particular deterioration in us growth is that we we could see some of those bedews mentioned a moment ago the occurrent ly at setting the earth head winds for gobert i move in a friendly fashion so allure or price law longtime interest rates a week or dollar arm could actually set the scene for a rat for a set prices too to swing up from the end of the summer one i think what so so really interesting about the last few months as that whilst you might look at a chart of bloaters and think how everything looks fine if you drill down a bit deeper and you looked at some of the sectors you've seen defensive sectors do much better if you looked at regions you've seen the higher beta regions before much worse so imagine markets have been particularly punished or in currency world you've seen some of the most unloved and and somewhat her defensive currencies do but better particularly the dollar er an ansell that sort of shift in mind set has played out i just paid it in different parts at the market but but i think if you look at the mood of the markets in the round i o'connor the consensus view to day is that we've had a bit of slow down but things are stabilizing and that risk appetite remains reason the healthy in the rounder there are what i sometimes refers his cracks in the ice these problems in the margin markets and dan one or two sectors and sore but these of views being the exception rather than the rule ah to combat your question what would get me more excited about buying risk i i'd like see the mark had become a bit more but more frightened of what's going on a foreseen to deter i i was and you'd stuff him well eh one can never see with absolute outina he likes to petitot think there say one would have to take that at that possibility much more seriously in in those circumstances or anna m a u seeing this same sort of uncertainty or arm are you taking more our comfort from me from from the data i think he is quite helpful to stay away from the market for a few months and then to come back and assess ah what's happening a with a fresh pair of eyes and when i came back and i looked at the and that the sentiment that a bill has just mentioned and verses at the data is a bit arriving to me how bearish the sentiment is because even though we have seen some gross desiderio a globule o exes a grosser is still well above trend and in most countries including the rare a perhaps a chinas will it despite slow down and so ah yes the growth is slower but we are not nearing a recession and not in ines or not in any other significant country and yet everybody seems to be on tenterhooks of nothing to be in our time in deserting that i would disagree with the view that he sent missus perish under other in sentiment is parish i think expectations of still for risk assets to deliver positive bretons in two thousand eighteen a and for this system too to haul together am i've had been through bearishness arm and believe me this is far from a bevis environment when poother people are bearish i you can you can feel a varied a heightened level of tension and and fearing market but it's my own experts no uri's it's not willis billson relative to a year ago by relative to a year ago i'd say that we were not much different ma'am vest as a year ago in the differences that things were accelerating picking up a year ago i to d i we passed a peak and things are slowing down and whilst the level or of various in disease indicators maybe the same as it was a year ago i you have to be cognisant the fact that day we we pass the peaks like came when napoleon went to air to moscow a he he went through various places on the way they only went through the same places on the way back the moony bank was very different from the midway there i think i'll say you look at positioning as image positioning and actually people are still generally every acts as to underwent bonds at so even if they might be more cautious in of what they saying is not necessarily being reflected in in those funds or are they being more cautious in what they're buying in the overweight equities are they being more selective do you think i think people are still broadly along the emerging marquesan and provider selling them as as as theseus progressed and certainly that sort that date would indicate if if that's kind of er i guess is a good indication of people's risk appetite am and furthermore i think you was after take that cyclical say dana and come over la what valuations of languages very high and on a psychical adjusted basis and so in that environment when vacations are high and great rolling over it does make you a little bit more worried i callet some move on to something of atys spoken about and a shot which was the trade war which is ramping up as we speak aptor between them yes and china how well it should we be about this because i am initially people were very sanguine that intervened the first round of foam of terraces that were being i am announced didn't really make any difference they register a little blip on mum on the chance but it does seem to be getting more serious i know i think it's right there the initial a announcements were very much written off as tramp just doing what he doesn't and sending tweaks out and not really doing much about it and that hasn't really proved to be the case it didn't think center a sentiment in fact i think there's a negative sentiment entia to what's going on from an asia spectre an in the secondary so i guess thing you have to inquire what how does that actual effect that the data and i think it does affect the way that a business is behave and highly think by investing and if we look at china china's already syphilis slowing ah so i do think it may make the the trains comtat very vulnerable moment and bill on the trade was he described as as being the grit in the system what what did he mean eh what i mean is that they wif we've enjoyed a very smooth a free flowing tree marmot and day a macarena varmint for the last thirty thirty five years in markets of been dominant and day efficiencies have been sought out by by companies and day never was benefited by the notion of applying tariffs er and and slowing a gobble trader an encouraging companies too to fevered domestic production over a production in the the laws cost embarkment those kind of developments i or in a saintly quintal putting grit in the global economic machine i you you in in encouraging inefficiencies into the system and that that's what i meant bellamant come in anna which you expect this or when would you expect this assault showing up in me in the data ah well it's really hard to say because of a very uncertain does not jester and in the the size of fat the tariff the mount but also the and retaliation by china over the country and to what products sir are affected and words what's the substitution elasticity there are so many variables that you would need to know too precisely as to my deputed but various estimates suggested actually the democratic is relatively benign i could be relatively benham of growth and inflation and but also think her and if we assume that this is going to be a er protracted the fair either it's not the metamora a thing is actually going to a continuer the next two years and perhaps in some sense like breaketh we're not going to get a big negative shock in the next quarter because of this it's going to last for a long time and perhaps slowly put downward pressure wanted to be enough with pression inflation but it's not a one quarter phenomenon and an attempt of her that reflected in in asset markets am i i think it's reasonable to expect in the short run modest probably very modest adjustments to to growth expectations down was marie small arm but the the discovery effect i might be a bit greater it introduces uncertainty into the system it depresses mignon growth expectations mediator expectations about investment arm and day and an that's i said price negative because that that's one of the things that own is really interesting that nobody can really anticipate what president trump is going to do next so how do you companies react am how do you how you anticipate how this is going to and play out over not just one quarter as ye say anna bert term but over multiple multiple years child i think they are thinking through this sire as we speak am so as some talk that perhaps one of your company producing something in china may be you go and move your productive says he's into tyranny and you sell them into the rest there but then may be the secondary consideration is all well what happens if trump decides that he doesn't want juster do that and then comes after us in tanana am and so probably at the place back ready to walk both than lane said is that he get a period of that of doing nothing stagnation almost er on these decisions and and that overtime is great negative i think a useful way of of thinking about this effect am is to train teetotum over the picture for a moment and and think about u s policy arm for a number of people of suggestion of uncle subsidies that even if tromp hadn't won the year two thousand sixteen election the u s would be taking a more aggressive stands on on the tree front and particularly where with regards china so if you except that u s policy for several years looking forward is likely to be a focused on changing in the stating relationship with china then what one can make some judgments about how that's likely to play into finite bringing trump back into the picture how he's zigzag to own that direction of travel frankly asked anyways guess ah and i don't think anyone can see with great confidence that they know what the next moves goito be but if you knew the direction of travel then you can submit with me some judgments that might be right for china though but if you're europe poor why it reduces historic allies this is all coming as a bit of a shock tea and so trump has really made this a much more a global issue favoured that not just to china specific issue and this is why ask about the global economy because i am so many economies are now interlinked and with the global economy with the betrayed that is untravelled and a through many different markets and parts for different in whether its parts for phones or parts for cars or have you and it could all start to and revel under that's that thee the grew in the machine that you describing and in a little more detail the efficiencies that weave fair we've taken advantage of the last thirty five forty years an if you start to tear apart those supply chains i then persisted that the machine won't walk as well as it once did i think also things given the cyclical back drop that we've talked about for last copper months deteriorating things always look a bit worse through that lens and if it wasn't for the fact that growth was already slowing i think as you say markets might take a more our optimistic view and sale this isn't going to be one quarter of fact but it's the back drop that colours the thinking asiatic yea unthink there's an important point that charlotte meets there if we go back twelve or eighteen months when the cycle was swinging up once i investors are inclined to nor longer town negatives because the forecastle on the fact that things are getting better and there are likely to contain to get better once you passed the peak and thee that the view becomes actual things are getting worse and may be going at once again then you look at those longer term influences in a slight different way i had rowland pushing to one side you think me that i will work were sickly slewing and there are small things that don't look a good either that that pleased on investors mind well i think we all need cheering up and with delight i announce that term it's time to play hot cakes and hot potatoes what would you buy like a hot cake and had you drop like a hopital a charlotte a water your hot cakes first of all i would say a mexican a currency i'm even the acting market i think we've got through that the worst of the uncertainty with the elections and it's a structurally healthy economy certainly relative to the rest of that tame very sink into the u s which is still doing all right and for how much longer i sleep a bit longer and there could be some catch up to be had there as your opiate european equites prime deering very soon ah now i am certain am europe is to some extent leading that the dancing am asano dear basis is one of the the worst and forming markets and its being caught in them the headwinds of of trade and the autos which is germany into the big path partington i think that sir a problem i came anna your hot cake was you infusing about now your back i railly going to go for em emeutes the landlord cities he imagine i get even those structurally and don't particularly am like the sassacus for a number of reasons i think tactically given the correction that already seen and it might be a good opportunity right now again on the very worst play to be shut and faces a yes within imagine my cadet outside but as as a concept to as sanusians i think is attractive for this pendant time what would you drop like a hopton while the sleep side there has to be the dollar eh it's it's extremely hard to have a very high conviction on the doll right now and there i hear also to feed of all different different views in different arguments and but fore he am to do well at the dollars to that either at least be stable or to weaken somewhat and actuating perhaps at the and narrowing air of the interested he french shells particular between the fat and the siberian some other banks i my tim and give rise to this transistor over the next you must to the end of the year so i think a wicked dollar i'm so so salado so absolutely o k and bill at your hot cake eh my hoke's cally related to and what anne is just as great im i think the door's been weaken it's likely the the us economies weakened arm and i think you have treasuries the the tenure bond am wid de deliver positive bretons against the backdrop or where i am a buyer of ten your treasuries at your cellar of enamel of the semi conductor sect am sammies are famously and violently cyclical and the last two years has been wonderful for companies in the semi conductor sector i but there are

06.wav,a hallo and welcome to the august edition of rich pickings for elsie's asses allocation pot curse i am wretched again to day i'm heading back through our offices in the rain at the to hear it has the long hot summer in the u k come to an end it certainly feels like it to day that is the long bull run in markets coming to an end's wealth that's a rather more difficult question one that the team tries to answer in this month's discussion turkey features of course along with china's policy decisions are they enough and how long can the u s keep loitering along listen on for some rich pickings joining me in the studio of three of the multi acid team we've had a day to digest the acid allocation meeting anna stumble economist put fully manager george stertorous and james bateman chief a vessel officer no we always start with an off topic and yet probing question anna if you could become an instant expert in anything what would it be and that to be astronomy an astronomer yet i always looking into the stars and wondering thus far but you could be telling us about it in future george i wave my rich pickings one to make you an instant expert in speaking the turkish language as is professionally or a personal interest for libbie turkeys is easin aborn at the same time ticks in the eye of the storm and a legacy of everything is tomo or not tametomo kanturk ish a very dismay we'll come to that i'm sure it fresh from his holiday james and ud like become an instant armchair expert inn so i was torn between two richard so either am early twentieth century british art or anthea physics so in either all you are an expert in at least twenty century not enough of an expert except the cape reckless get on and two were at the business now at gently start with the allocation headlines this month whatso'er what the news or indeed is there any for i guess what's interesting richard is arm and not been going on in market petition the last few days arm real concerns building where worries we spent hours debating and discussing and decided to make no changes to our position very arm now i think you you have to characterize that in light of the fact that we had de risks with movement is a couple months ago with a view that there would be volatility over summer there is volatility over the summer period we were sat in the meeting actually almost questioning while we more worried about that and i think the answer was we'd whilst we had no idea what the catalyst would be if we said he didn't think it was goin to be turkey no one and said that three months ago the fact to the matter is a we had expected something something has happened and we'm very much sitting back waiting to see what happens i could leadest dearest marcus leister a by assets on arm weakness o k and breathless through what the locations are if you can sure so we are minnetarees were over wake cash and underwent fixed income at a broad ascent within the regions we are and we've got very few positions on where under weight the euchar continued be under it the uk and were overweighed japan and japan cly a very good risk of area including the currency a cape and now for something completely different you may recognize this glissade of shepherd tons and arral effect that keeps on rising higher and higher building tension anticipation that something has to happen but it never does can anyone see where i'm going with this yes let's talk markets their rise and rise and turkey eadie to it james could it be the thing to halt this bull market for her for good now george m you described a perfect storm hitting turkey an earlier it saves office not to man in turkey what what did you mean well turkey has actually been one of those countries that has been identified with the lot of exempts as we have been seeing and liquidity being drained from the system in of the fed razing ridge the dollar being strong and takes vicinities what has happened in morison months is would be different and has led to the morrison selav is lack of credibility after the that the changes have seen at the central bank arm and at the same time a political situation that is making are investors very very uncomfortable with the sime with u s indeed so where is it going how how do you all feel about turkey am ito ito is a situation that is changing a lot day by day have you changed your view on the country james so yet we don't have a material drest on in just just in turkey anyways will have a moglaut exposure both connecting a depth perspective but it is broad and diversified and i think our starting point is when situations of this fluid moving this fast that's not the time to make rapid changes in a port folio so i think it when i think about turkestan rots implications are not really focussed on the first drive him impact witches turkish stocks of turkish bonds and thinking if it really goes wrong if the situation really does get out of control or of the second and third drift of impact so european financial for example contagion risk into other emerging markets and and i guess that's how we think you more broadly and as he were on a balance that and that the fact that may be want to reduce some risk there in an in prospect of intention happening with the fact that may be it won't and actually maybe this is a storm in a teacup and and six weeks to eight weeks down the line the market will moved on back to a positive narrative george agrees is is this miser a risk of contagion or is it contained that is the key thing we've been debating in the team how could the tradition mechanism resolved in in contagion risk in us james mentioned it could be actually through the banks of the banks i stop blending into other parts of the market especially to emerge market princes that have a lot of external adept did a lot of dollar for instance i coincident but is turkey and isolated case the way that it's going wrong does that matter is it idiots and critic definite on elements of a discredit risk in the sense that cried ability lack of or the political situation and mortify the image mac countries don't have both the might have won them out of the other but don't have both so not respectively by more decoratin but we still do worry about that big of the potential of contagion risk and anna what you think i think come turkey ease er airs systemic country in the sense that a m the crisis has the potential to spill over to an other markets particularly to those countries that are also quite wonder ball such as sameness of africa brazil and perhaps some other meter market and it's not the story for gentian of nisaea that we have seen of the pastor a few years it's bigger it's a very vulnerable am and this is all happening in the environment where her goblin is getting withdrawn and so far by the fat but also next year by the b m and some of the big central banks so i think a we should be complacent about it a particularly in the late stage of the cycle where other risks sir and are intensifying and if it were to spread where would be next you think perhaps sir the the most honorable e m serafina brazil em over all the time a a perhaps as central europe as well even though that do have these potentially and helping better and mentioned brazil that ready would matter wouldn't it as as a large economy he exactly tes it's very big again an exposure affrights to comprador to a sovereign is sir big abuses the still don't have a stable political situation and james what could trigger this contagion what are you looking for am as sir e took about a very fluid situation in turkey button what could book make this spread so amid i think the the interesting as you never quite know why you get contagion of his achates its sentiment in its panic and its essential that the average narrative average mockersons narrative shifting from we got an isolated problem to one that could be more systematic so i'm er one thing that could coloma it more systemic is simply i'm yours own banks being forced to write down i'm all right off turkish debt and that would have a massive impetuous e would also though have a big impact on a other emerging countries working the market would start saying what if this is next ithin brazil is a clear example where that could happen that the market says o k weston's have in turkey very bad where it can be next it's going to be a brazil a the bigger risk in that is not just that it happens to those countries by the actual you get a mass of negative sentiment across all emerging markets indiscriminately we saw an your indian currency sell off i am quite substantial arm on the turkish news you look at that netherland ally indias not in the same situation but the market sentiment is depressing everywhere a and that that's what makes it with horses stomach for acting more or more into bigger impact in terms of the overall market and i just want either this disconcertion that sir james took him about it is not going to just spread to him and stay there ah this this has the potential to be such a big financial shock that it would spread to demerara and including the u s and with tight and financial conditions so dramatically that it could affect economic growth elsewhere particularly deventer is particularly u s and i think if i can come in what what's particuliere sting at moment is the ass has been almost immune to it see a little bit of volutes of the most day but base speeds been immune to it and and that doesn't give the u s a an incentive to help resolve the issues clearly if you stop seeing it impatiently you as either economically ar in the markets and that changes the ass is incentives in creditors of bruno resolved the turkey crisis and both politically and in terms of policy economic volition without that even separate in inness in this case i think tether two are utterly intertwined a cape will lift me to the bigger picture anna you said in your brief ink yesterday that the u s set conditions for the rest of the world china sets the grocer gender for the rest of the world it is a mixed picture for china amount is it it is mixed a growth has said if hayden slowing and as we now day in a big stimulus that we saw in twenty sixteen has been as early i was drawn so the investment and infrastructure her has fallen there quadratics and an then now we see that term some of the activity indicator saucer slowing am a on the other hand em er there's been some small steps or to try to leave in the down sight and growth ah but there's a sense that those sir policies directed towards frisco when raising a probably not going to be enough i too put afloat to the slow down dear to agree georgia they committee enough polly not yet although they have somewhat changed direction and with change of direction also comes opportunities so one of the areas that were actually been discussing in the team is asian credit china high yield china credit and that's been one of part of the ebb what part of the market that has actually sold of significance the mining of the year a law more than european high elverson the back of the intimidation and we've been slowly sam looking at that as an opportunity market but whip looking then for a catalyst and this somewhat change of direction from china we thinks has put a bit of a stop in the spread winnington and no heels are actually very attractive a case that china was a bat and the echinus first of all hear from some one with concerns in the short clip as usual we've taken refuge in one of the staff kitchens hear it for dese for a quick digression with a portfolio manager and joined this time by bill macrae bill hallo to you and bishop hello that the the economics look fine in the states that fed is on cautious maneuvers the asserters up was not alike i think there's a variety things not to like actually i'm worried that there's are a complacency to round the united states as you rightly see a lot of good stuff has happened but if one looks under the surface and looks the future as far as under the office is concerned the consumer party's fine but if you look at the house market if you look at athos by there surprisingly weak for an apparently healthy economy when i consider the things at a slut other parts the world like there the high oil price in the fact that real intreaties have risen under the spite the u s is not mean from that and it still enjoyed the benefit of the wheat dollar last year but this year the doors be stronger and i think all of those things in the second half of this this year may begin to weigh on the unmusical it could be that that optimism that you describe is has got feely short shelf way from you so not as good as i was painting and am i presume that that means that you are under weigh to yes while i say that's not the case as we stand at the moment arm and that's really because my my view this year has been that we we want a hunker down and be somewhat defensive with a thoughtful allocation and the u s is a classically defensive market or to to this point time i i've actually like to the us equity market but for the reasons of just articulated i i think we need to re appraise that view and make a judgment of whether those defensive characteristics woe be as helpful in the second half of the year as a happy in the fosse bill went on to say that he asked himself every day whether the u s will continue to serve as a safe haven and anna are you as concerned about mercers as he is i am more optimistic than the on the yo's economy a particular talking about to the second half of this year and and there of course i agree that the u s is in the late cycle and the things that turn nd that bill is concerned about i am as surely the the characteristic of the late cycle nor perhaps the consume a a house instead of the house in marquesan under water sect et cetera but there are two key thinks that support the us economy to the end of the year in potentially through twenty nineteen and that as the fiscal supports the di fiscal boasts to transposes that have given such a a lift to the economy eh yes the traitor and here also a the montrose of again if you look at the financial conditions they still remained very accommodated we have since some tightening a moreover the last few months but it's still not enough to put a significant jug when you was grosso i i do agree that you are going to sail slow down from a the four per cent a growth that was so inkyo ah but i don't think it's going down to trend or below then it's not going to be very rapid so i'm optimistic for the entity to all things being equal james i am certainly nothing to knock market that it should plough on i mean educate an eventful sentiment could not the market and its its uproar and has been an almost unbroken arm with some bit of wabbles in in the tex stocks not that long ago other than that are mostly very positive ina and i do agree with anna and an you alluded to that time i'm not long back from holiday was in the u s and yet that the positive sentiment there the sense of confidence from the average consumer is unwavering and an ultimately confidence is a large part of what drives the economy market and that is positive and therefore i think the u s a in idiocies typically defensive that's good if if markets are all over but equally i think it could well continue to leave pockets of i will just like that on the one of the the dixon of the defensiveness of the ores morgen i mind my thinking he is that when the problems are excellent out of the us that's when the rest market becomes a defensive market if however our problems to pulling in within the us market i am not drugs can to be exactly as defensive as in messrs expected to be especially at a time when funds investors are of the highest allocation overweight to the use wear that have been in a very long time so it's primed for something to go wrong innocence and that in addition with vain narrow leadership that we have seen am a very few number of stocks that are pushing the market higher precisely when i came generate a point in er the meeting about tactics and time horizons at being under weight doesn't necessarily mean selling off to day and how does that plate play out in port figures so i think you clearly when you're when you're investing are to be taken since on a day base is not in a month for your you know quarterly basis and on that basis you might think were trending towards an underway or trending towards an other you've got to time those positions i think when we look at i'm your mergy markets now one of the debates we had is is this a buying opportunity should be selling at this point for example given the turkey situation and anything the answer was hold fast but with a view that you need to be quite tactical on a daily basis but in what happens and an ear one of the things you have to think about whenever managing a portfolio is what's happened to day has the market over reacted verses reality and should i therefore change my position and in particularly when sentiment of short ten sentiment drives markets the ability to take very short term decisions when you see what effectually become is an irrational dislocation can add a lot of value a cape and let's assume then that earned things bumble along as they are as they have been for the next couple of weeks or so when should we start to be wary of a big shift in a in sentiment if we look over at the last few years it's been very late august aly september when volatile she's picked up a bit we've in a bit more am market concern i'm not sure whether that is a kind of pinched back to school or whether that simply as people beginning to look forward to to the next year and an looking what's gonna happen in this type this case in twenty nineteen roth in just folking on twenty eighty so that what drives it with their lilies an ole re assessment at that point a an aegis report for his mareotis went mostly back in the office looking at things with a clear head at re assessing but interesting me everything or time will seen voluted to their markets then we resumed their upward trend and so i i think it would be very very of worrying if you took the view that because that was happening or that might happen youssef roscoff george you are about to go away on holiday are you to be happy to switch on your out of office a reply until you come back i guess so owen when one goes a hole is i guess always happy to do them but none has deftly has to be a on on top of things even even went away because it is a ghost there is lack of liquidity and things are moving what i would be looking at is to what extent we see this spread whining environment continue and if we see also kindes across midge markets continued to evalee that would probably then lead to negatron if sentiment could venture to outflow from miser market that would make me worry a little bit more i came well were almost out of time not before we play hot kicks and appetites what would you buy with enthusiasm like a hot cake and what would you drop like a hot potato anna as some hot cake is the japanese vases the dollar and i think it has some er both the fundamental reasons sir to to be stronger relative to her it is now albert as of course the sentiment is in it it's one of the safe havens sam out there in case of any shocks of crisis and my hot potato would be and let an american equities sir and emerge architectures within the er latimer perhaps missus asia and going back to the thing that we discussed her on vulnerability within them and an also er they have rated them quite well so i think of that would be something or to sell there absolutely case george your hocks my hot cakes would be m l p s which stands for master limited partnerships essentially it is a relatively cheap way to play the energy or markets specials when late cycle and enterprises have been i grant you grinding upwards and it's also a way to play the market with a very attractive and high yield and i've got to ask what is a master limited polish i don't i don't know it's essentially pipe lines michie pines in the s in scenting the pipe lines that on the transports oil are not the extraction companies are not on the oil itself but the means of getting it around precisely which means they have decent relation with with all prices but at the same time some immunity from big frolic utility and change your hocks sung in to be in pretty short termine in my views on this summit my hot cake is u s tips cyrus an efficient protected treasuries arm they provide to be long duration good hedge if if markets fall from here and elation protection and i am still worried about reflection getting out of control partly driven by that the constant grinding up of oil price aim of yours in richemont has not been a change probably than on the other on the hot potatoes side its european equities in really european financial arm which worried me because there is this contagious from turkey and i think whether or not turkey completely gets out of control you could see a material very short term downward relating of them on the concerns of what would happen if there is a full blown turkey quite the surprising levels of exposure that there is well but tim and y think of emerson de for that chance and that's all for this month's portcullis again next month on we hoped still to be ascending gradually without

07.wav,oh hello and welcome to the september edition of rich pickings fidelities acid avocation poncas i am written dear in chief and this month i back in the church of saint mary alder mary a place for contemplation and happily restoration by coffee from the shop at the bank i have put my cavatina to one side because in this month's purcas we delved deeper into data that suggests the slow down in the global economy may be about to bottom out how emerging markets might knock that sunny picture and why australia is better than new zealand oh yes indeed listen on to find out why johnny mean the studio are three of the meassefim back from their summer break and already deep into their acid location wrangling they are charlotte harrington markets and at a shot at this month i want to know before we get going what your in most irrational fear you say heights which although that is not totally irrational it does become a rational when your inner a hotel room say and you can't put the curtains open the curtains for fear of looking out the window that i surlily ought to get to know also where this his poor fellow manager mat crave met what nonsense gives you goose bumps i am really like being rational had every avanti nal affair but a of this very irrational thing of after ages snoring i dream about it and i wake myself up because every time fall over in the dream i actually john pot fed at to the point where my wife now went sleep in the same bed as how fisher your wife's rational fear of yes noble esses actively glasses he also my third guest as always as james bateman chief and vesta's office of the mosaic james what's your most irrational fear why yet i would never admit it was a rational but an i'm not big friend of spiders but since some can kill you i'm not completely irrational as i say uncertainly preclude certain am geographic areas for for holidays absolutely basement ly sensible to me but before get game as he quickly had the great decide to position itself this month has there been any change to the milty asset allocation or i'm sorry to disappoint you richard but the answer is no i remind as well be all return position in which his neutral equities overrate cash under weight fixed income we did have a bit of a debate whether we should act new tries our cash and fixed in compositions as wells if he neutral in everything we a bit but you you cannot change your position without passing through neutral at the margin we will probably over the next few months be reducing cash an increasing fixed income so that would just be a path to remove that we know again likely to make did you set us up for it i'm very well i am surely did you agree with them where we ended up i think mere broadly and probably a bit more risk of us than that side probably prefer to hold a bit more duration and envies positive on on the act market and logic of just the fundamentals were also because within the act market it's ready been the estes the rest under and that sort of convergent sticks like it so possible and met how you are you relined with the rest of the group now unclose to charlotte and probably meanly on the bone side of things an i like holding some duration here sentry the logic i apply is if you put a recession at any point in the next ten years threes and looks pretty good on her yours ten year ah and therefore willing to hold it writes well amphora bit more detail on the numbers are in that discussion i cast up with rockets annalist in samson and asked him about fidelities leading indicated the fly has been stuck in the negative and worse and in quartet for six months in a row exactly where you don't want it to be but he explained that the bosom of this cycle isn't yet here but may be near the well one the identical contending heard them under the convent idea honored by half in quite so they've reached the bosom the contay tracked that the momentum of that negative signal is as being to fade out there's some sense of civilization now i always caution not tread too much into this but given that the housecarls design to lead both by about three months that night of dissolution seems to be blossoming out perhaps around the turn of twenty nineteen we might be talking about actually things stabilizing now walk can drive that economically but we've always said that there hasn't been a significance of marconi shock i given how strong both was last year truely move us from a miya laid table into actual procession ary territory there's no real candidate for it for while i should happen so stabilization i think was all the summing he expects it and at its signs of the looks like were getting a bit closer to so i being sort of teetering on the brink if you like foot for another month but it suggests that perhaps and the world is becoming as safe a place i could on speaking or could knock that therein sure well it has to be emerging markets and right at the cross hairs of slowing chinese growth a fat tightening and a stronger dollar and an more idiots and classic blobs or sarsen and the really vulnerable mercy markets the likes of turkey and argentina a hero say this in cresco mean that at the conditions there are unique to those individual colonies and not the sort of thing that might spread like wildfire through other countries sure that the conditions that are so much worse than there are and other emerging markets and terms of curiae a external decides and so much worse that we don't think you can extract from there to india in denis a even young mexico and so while these countries well sound or pressure still it doesn't feel like where we in existential risk her stage quietly at your name out of it one that was in sensible show it can aside here and do you agree with his assessment i think on image market specifically there's been of a sea that's pen where the actions been all all yea i we sin the currency lectica and the fixing come market will set off quite aggressively and as he anseis been down to a stronger dollar that the fat tight anger and a chinese a grate and also trade tensions with the ass so whilst the move has been quite aggressive am the conditions that had so have formed the back drop for that mover probably largely in place and particularly on the china side of things where yes they are starting so to stimulate the economy of a rare a long way from ready seeing that the data change of the back fat and a change even explained how a the conditions in turkey and argentina are unique at least to some degree if he could be to im but what about the other countries would about this idea of contagion where should he be looking had been much more concerned about of curse i think he'd your right has the question and that whenever when you you see her any suner country as its systemic is it who is hideous in critics waited export and apply lots o the places was it contained to that country that region and i think when we look at turkey we don't see it instructor is a systematic issue we don't think it menthol is like to impact all emerging markets and act enough for we think to an extent that the negative sentiment around a merging markets has been overdone am it may be that the other eversleigh's own another country's brazil reilly as a tumultuous political situation and i do only will be the next turkey but i think they could never revilement more than argentina it's a large part of the market arm with with a lot of implement household dame stocks then what's interesting like this those that although we might identify paces like turkeys and being less systemic actually the seton aim has been very broad based so it was sing and intenser seeing in india all these places there are supposedly in inaba situation as so it's its heart are ready to draw a line such matara tonal response perhaps but the mood is changing randolph i think is that she three levels to it as one is m is it purely idiosyncratic and or is it systemic but though the way we discard performs as that it is in crusty going to affect everything else but actually the pockets of of issues you see in em have an underlying systemic an element i erst of liquidity the and the tiding of an of manitous and and the that the fact that that puts it canoes it makes the tide cloud italic it's sort of leap frock frogging from one event to the other but actually an everything is might might not have at the particular story of the day but everything's moving in that direction and it is this global backdrop of of slower growth and a strong dollar and effects ere the u s seems to be steering a lot of that yearly raised that nurse but in can you expend little bit more shores about why american matters so much at the moment i well from an active sect of its of isly a very large part of the index and from a fundamental perspective are the the u s a monetary conditions to a large extent for and not the world and say this sir gradual pace of normality as these the federal poses as starting to titan policy not just in the asbyte elsewhere the fed has the same day sir that every one else has so what's the interpretation that every one else seemed to be hoping the fred is going to be putting on that datum yes it's interesting are the fed i think of her laid out there their plan if you like it beneath this year which ester to hide rates towards neutral which they estimate without two point seven five to three per cent and then take a pause i don't see a huge mount to ready change that view at the moment er i think it's entirely possible that u s great slows a bit from here and that that great hike path still ends up and in the same place but perhaps slows in terms of the pace may be skipper quarter whatever and but but that's would be that this of the interpretation of their fancy but just a go to take care shouts pontois further and you the fed is a sentry selling march eupolis for seventeen scent of the world near commodities financial systems alone or all dependent but the fred's mandate isn't that the female is domestic and say what were you seeing to a certain degree is this a disconnect between financial markets and that al mandate fed and you'd need i am either for that a domestic picture to change or for that other picture in the rest of the world to affect the domestic pitcher further fetal take note of it and change their course because of it but if no man is an island then the fedai realize that its own economy is going to be affected and if the policy that it sets affects the rest of the world and this is this is a subject that gets wrestled with a lot and their different opinions on it and and hem i think that's where it comes down to some personalities within the fan how they interpret that biting they would ready and have to interpreter as it's going to affect the domestic economy and their forewarns us but that if this is this is the thing with benicia's it's am it hasn't necessary been set in a time when the wind of her fete has been so dominant to financial market so i think we can have is slightly see what see what comes how excise make a couple of observations as round on that is at firstly that there is evidence that the interest rate sensitive parts of the economy are being impacted by higher interest rates say housing vehicle calls these are great sensitised and their slowing or on the other point around there the affery being being quite balanced at her einar in one of the issues for them is that you've had a boost from tax cuts a which which we know is is is temporary and likely to fade and that makes their job all the more difficult because they don't want to over tighten into a picture that ultimately is going to slow on its own accord answering that that adds an extra twist all of this at quite a short term twist as well because we expect that stimulus to run out by the end of mixture by and next year watches sir when you think of the leads and lags in and policy making and neutralise policy because you let in kirtle in pack the next year in that sort of explains why why they possibly set on the more cautious side in with that's the way that policy is being decided that of course or affects the rest economy but the biggest driver in the mercanson m is its consumers and how healthy minute it looks to be booming at the moment jones indeed it does richard my thing in what interesting is is that both anecdotal and and in the data consummate is very strong arm and and more am on the benicia unless scene recently is the ability of our culprits to push through pryings soracte regaining pressing parkins you maar i'm continued to spenser which is was a very strong sign for the economy and indeed i think some of our arm interest mates suggesting that we were pushing out the downton another year in the years oconostota pretty major i think the related point of that they coming back to the federal policy is is clive am if if first will they have pricing power a mass assign a further invasion to come and claims away with continuing just a moment that the other thing that perhaps might undermine that rosier picture is an not everybody is convinced by the am a future of theism it seems and if you stop looking at capital expenditure capes e that companies say they are going to invest but seemed to be sitting on that cash instead so that there are a uncushioned that that's been a philaminte years market for a long time that interesting point that that when the actions made this morning to us was that it is getting had a distinguishing kopecks and ope and pertinax panic arm and therefore actually looking at the heady numbers might be giving that you the wrong impression will come right she doing so they are spending ethic common is a definite spending the divel investing wetly we might push on whether it's enough we might question whether that there's an element of caution with some companies but at the same time i'm adieu etoit hard to build a narrative that said u s companies are acting cautiously and worrying about him and had donned her they're not worried bet and i interrupted you earlier when you wanted to talk o passin fleein your famously worried about is inflation are we now entering a time when your fears come true only my my concern is increasing m and arches as we discussed a last week in a separate conversation am when i was investing one of them that the books required reading at the start was the death of inflation by by little and ever since then it struck me a bit my eve that inflation is over as a concept arm a magasin unusually long period where that is removed central a bank in depends in the nineteen nineties and benign or negative economic conditions am if combined to mean that the inflation hasn't hasn't really read its head it's likely to again is most like to when people not expecting it making a still element of nativity in the market about to inflation and anerton wage of raging in price invasion and you got impact loyally put one of those together and you say this feels like the precursor fro above target inflation and fleeced surprises it doesn't feel like a a a country in any way worried about these things at the moment does at the ours no the yes i'm behaving as if there there's an inflation problem i say but i think it is a likely their inflation continues to to grind up in the aliment that were in and i think what's ready starlight the inflation picture of rules how much it's been impacted by course prices say to pick up an oil eventually feeding through from headline and intercalation an anse whilst it might not be the kind of wage generated inflation that that would worry the fed a it is is elamites people feel it her and actually er if you look at real wages going back to the east consumer railways are i'm not looking so healthy because the face of wage increases he is is being eroded by that inflation picture i keep well we're almost at the engineer which means its time to play hot cakes and hot potatoes what would you buy like a hot cake what would you drop like a hot potato shoot at your hot cakes i am going to say er the teniente within the acting market a tensity well when er rates for but it also as well when the act market turned gazed at taxes here and so if you had that environment in which rates that she spiked causing the act he set off than i think you jerseys was still do quite well in that as your opposite out while i made to make a sect a trade son and say the consumer discretion sector it has always under formed in in late cycle er and actually this optimism around the strength of the scoter is a little bit worry and given all the other a thinks that were seeing in terms of that dispense would income i mentioned er and and these interstate sensitive sectors i came something to watch out match with your hot cakes what he really liked women given i made a reference to snowballing on the on going a bit of paste and were there australian olives sir athenians olives keep with you can see quite a large divergence in and constance in the economy here in surveys and between the two and in general this a divergence of the economy implies that that cross should isid i should go in the benefit of australia and to continue your snowballing thing what would be the white page what's your trap they felt her head the way about my optat is a yes i yield ah it's been having a great time because of the tax cut because the earth is doing so well but had been completely amending to everything else was going on and it is feels like the area that could go wrong and if other things go i came all downhill from here so aunt james sir finally we come to you at your hot cakes my hotoke is am somewhat conversely compared to probus on my colleague's views an asian imaging markets i think am sentiments beaten not too much they are strictly undervalued are mary to be theages of form as whilst he'd pick up the currents you've got the tenth of a double rebound right er critter quite spike he spoke when they would but you operation so they work my opiates european an alexandrian but hurting for a while he has but pursuit if emmy i'm slightly worried that there's upside potential from a breadless m i'm off the european activate am as as a hope because it could bounce and i'm really worried about your pinker dat ah simply because a went with the magical pictures in great continues not to be great prexy isn't a structurally structure improvement there arms even get sentiment bouncing equities its not is not as sostratus am and therefore married about arm decline fortunes for urbino studying me impressed into the fixing cammock and the easy bees stepping away at the end of the year ye a and on that happy note i'm afraid rout to time i hip that give me an insight into the thinking behind this one's

08.wav,allo i'm richer edgar and this potass is for investments professionals only her more for the best part of a decade the global economy has grown and grown but there are early signs at the type may be turning and if that's the case then your running for the hills what's an investor to do the old rules have either been forgotten or no longer work in a world very different from the one before the global financial crisis i am richer in today i've gathered some of it at isis leading thinkers to help him up with the answers for how to invest in a world less certain johnny me in the studio aronach of equity steve elise had a fixing come in europe and james batman chief investment officer for matinees no a question for all of you before we yet get going at the risk of being indiscreet you're all old enough to remember the crisis fifty thousand seventy thorstein but young enough for it to have shaped your careers and perhaps you're thinking say what i'd like to know first of all is what surprised you most are in the years since during the great bull runs a leconte james wiswall so i guess i i actually begin richard by saying i am quite princely got jobs arm ideal inner in eight am i was in the office or brock in london next to the leman's building watching every one leave i did feel like that was the end of the financial services industry and actually the fact that finances booming may be in different ways but action that the industries in pretty good health yet was this they've been amiss in trust with the industry and hatest investing were still seeing no real equity market was in the dep markets returned normality as well all of tricks and is a surprise yet it was not not without an awful lot of help from the central battle without a of help but i think we no do in in an end of september or eighth you felt the end was nigh and by much o knowing you were injuring the start of a bull market men in that that that was quite surprising i think how quickly in animal spirits began to return steve have you well i think the er the thing is really my surprise ment since thirty thousand at has been the extremely subdued nature of volatility and i think he goes back what you say richard about the help from central banks in in her supplying huge man toighty the banshees of the g three banks increased by about eighteen twenty dollars since then this provisional equidistant has been responsible for the very subdued nature of liquidity are of fervid seti rather and an they still has very much surprised me that we haven't seen more regular bats of volatile he given the fact that the in her dead levels in the globe economy now as so much higher than the way even back at thee the inner the eve of the crisis back in two thousand eight you still expect given the leverage has been building up ticking corporate and of patofa banks et cetera that you would have seen much more periodic episodes of volatility and risk of version but markets have been extremely resilient and durable and aerial perhaps well we will come to that i spose later on fell that he i think it is very possible are she because the liquidity tops have been turned off right now and the g well setting the fed are beginning to unwind his banshee and and raising to traits and that could be caused in a sudden cause and province going down the road it was sonny what about you what surprised you about this sir this remarkable period over not quite a decade against bringing in the market perspective in a bit broader not just just fixing commis how well we have all done in terms of a surprised inflation and a thing the most striking feature to me is the fact that markets across the board including fine wine all time as in any other kind of syllable assert catechist has done particularly well and has out performed the real economy that is is is a striking feature so is not only that we have jobs but how well those with jobs have done on the back of the extraordinary monetary policy support and this is why to me the most important question is if a steve has just high lighted we have now turned off the tops what is going to happen because we have to assume in this is something we have witnesses already and since the beginning of the year that actually markets can under perform the economy just because we have a very distinctive change in the way we have been supported for the past ten years onaisy can i come with uncommon on that story that the thing sonya hits a very important point there that that you see a disparity in the returns from being asset owner to being being when out she works and yes we will have jobs and that she yes in the other countries of employment is low but we haven't seen wage inflation was seeing tentative signs now but after it a decade from a rope from that from the start of the crisis and the average work isn't materially better off and that is a very unusual situation nine years i put his inferable mock i care i think you've all set us up for a discussion then and what i like to twenty now is what's their situation at the moment when we find ourselves right now sonya say what characterizes this particular cycle and where we are at the moment think the striking feature of twenty eighteen is the re assessment on where we are the cycle how aid in m sprite inflation stacks up how valuation levelled stack up and the volatility that has started really is just a sign of this recess men because people try to figure out whether the risk and the rest profile of their allure of their portfolios eteocles adequate for where we are in the cycle and empty the idea that growth might have piqued ose raises a lot of question marks and we have him touched on politics all the other headlights that have feda m round and and a really kind of raising uncertainty and it unfortunately means of wet wet shall i eat em in all the rules seemed to being chucked up into the air at the moment that you can't look at anywhere i am unexpected to behave in the way that it might have done before as we got to this stage in the cycle wittemore ably originally i think was interesting i'm not been a thump table because it will make a dreadfulness in the mark friends but if i did thump the table with our water glasses on it you'd see the water wobble and then looked the wabble so gradually decrease in go actually that's what happened this year with volatility that yes we are a spike in volatile you've seen that volunteers he again recede in the market and what so order this point the cycle is but there are so many reasons to worry yet from from inaba valuations and prospects of futurities beyond enamel next year at geologic et cetera and yet actually weak we see one cord of volatility and then we see that gradually reduce over the year and and that is absolutely a typical at this point in the cycle so if there's not a m and a jarring spasm that comes from somewhere and it sounds like it's going to be the turning off the taps that m is there is the critical thing here aunt steve i'm looking at you because at the fade is clearly fundamental to to what happens at next what should be move most weary of and as it transitions from constitute easing into tightening well onward i think it's the key thing for mark is right narrows they moved from cui to cute in reducing the balance which is about four norhala dollars and federalists well which urdaneta do liquidity and also the huge amounts of dolittle treasure tions that taking a place because of the and the budgetary expanse at thee in a very late cycle and and so that that draining of fugal equity what the important thing here is richard is that that dull liquidity is breedin in what we call the off shore a dolichos market in other words this has come of the erdmann which stand from petrol it's the huge amounts of dolius which is flowing around the global economy seeking yield and seeking no exposure to risk assets i am in environment of very subdued impersonality at its now heading home and well to what the reason i has hasn't so far hit to you as i think is that in the same time you've had a huge amount of dolore perturbation and because of the profit repatriation et cetera by in m evoked by trump and so thickly if you think about this is the statistics here so since april and money suppliant money supply in the globe offshore do licit market as that she fallen by two point four twilly dollars it's been a huge drainage of liquidity and that's why morgy markets have been under so much pressure is because it's really tinily crudity for your corporate sovereigns have been a boring in huge man of dollars in the lazars in you as empty money supplies that she increased by about three hundred fifty million dollars because of that money coming back on shore in other ways you see a cattle account drainage from the off shore and from the magi markets back into the u s a money supplied great as it should be quite robust and o us and that's why you're seeing very good performance of surprises in the u s whether its investment grade i yield ores mark its et cetera but sooner or later that turned that tap will turn off as well and it can be a lot more er undefaced for is assets i think on but what might stop the fete and it's not obliged to look international whether the picture it's only as mandate is just to look within the u s a m what sainte what could knock them of course well i think you had to have some severe marketing first and in whether happens he indirectly sore other words because it was happening in the major markes right now which seems frankly very low probability that is can derail that fed from contending with its federate heights and drainage delicacy i think it has to be something on shore that has that has to happen netherwoods you see massive am in spread widening years high yield your investment grade which causes a very sharp tightening and monetary conditions there and i think that's the anything i can really do rail a fed and suddenly caused them to go and hold and stop the ray hiking cycle and all to taper the basha unwind and its very possibly could early next ure though if if i made this is very important because i think that this is a bit of a change because a thing under pole we have seen a much larger focus on on the domestic issues than before janet ellinwood would normally refer or would see her much more a global central banker than what would polders and it will have implications because you know it did just shows the interconnected ness of the of the globe of financial system and rather whether they like it or not they are acacia that they are indeed but to the point is that aveline focused a lot on argentina and turkey and there were lots that would claim that their idiosyncratic risk in this jail pasts and i hear this but at the at the bottom of this is still that the problem that jem steve has just outlined and we're talking about a shortish and dolour m entry could add the under performance of the globe banks in the from an equites point of view that literally point in the same direction there is stresses in the system that so if i have only really am focused on the weakest links but we should not encore because they might have wider repercussions going forward a cabalistic at the other side of the sofa we are looking at the fed for intestate and growth are has been driven glover really by china james in indecent years double the contribution of the u s but that might be ending because am its worthy slowing at the moment how concern should we be so anything mean to look at training into contact one is and it's had a phenomenal overgrowth for for decades and secondly its slowing yes but from very high rates two still quite high rates and the second bite context is the last five year congress the party was very clear it intended to enact policies that would solve some of the rural urban divide but it sent home wood slow growth so we'd expect so ingrow th they forecast that was going to happen it's happened and is happening yet so the rokens on his not as great slope is it what often gets good hard landing as it does it fall below me maybe a reasonable expectation anita my best case is actually know that the ear the fairs over china are over exaggerated and over its angered partly because it's a very easy and popular narrative to go with because the data is somewhat obtuse its heart to reading now it's going on ah but when you actually look at trina what you seen as is accompanies one is yes instruction of real estate are at market see are rolling over a bit you seeing it she can sum a confidence am in elysees optic some airy's flat anuti still positive arm all but one answer or midleton and therefore no you look at esau ly you seen a bit of a refusing a bit of rebounding but of a change but then roll back and take a big picture a cochin and so will actually that this would have what they'd call their secondary or tertiary cities but those cities with populations actually about the size of london and not small cities and have virtue known for structure yet are industrialists and in a world in which you have a country that has cities of populations of five to ten million with virtue no interstate armed that there in the process of dust rising and being used as a sort of labour often at shed by the west or in nineteen us there is a phenomenal and potential rapide clee there's nora respect is right in air we can't ignore that the potent for a trade war or the fat rentre word of any how he liked to define her mean my guess is that a bit of a storm in a teacup in an a couple years would back and say came ever there are some tariffs in place but it's been broadly resolved but but that does create some some short to meet him turn downside risk but duke do i believe the engine of growth is derailed if that aeon china i do not if in america does or doesn't see itself as the the world's central banker and does china consider it has a rolling global grass at sonya is it and purely are domestically focus for that they stood a came to the rescue last time it's a very interesting question and tim i think is something that will be re defined of the next decade or so because we are literally and on the edge of of seeing the old kind of world order changing quite dramatically and in that context we have the question wrong the world central bank and the reserve currency and the world's kind of growth driver and so far it has been a clearer picture on whose hook this might change overtime and i think we're just currently if you look at the shorter term picture always end in his big and of unknown weather and the new normal for chinese growth i think we all agree will not provide a new stimulus in that important differentiation because it means for us from an acid pamper or a valuation point of view that there might be not a new catalyst that kind of we could hang our hedge on his sail while it's great and that that's the big differentiation begins to efore past couple of years china always provided this new stimulus where where this time wrought they might not do this and just except that it will be a lower level and more sustainable lever of growth and i think that spattering differentiation i think for the time being m that more important obviously has a domestic motivation buses around also the indebtedness and the sustainable ty of new dead levels and and has hence you know your probe could argue this is more domestically oriented but we have seen a much greater awareness of their responsibility in terms of globe foreign policy and their kind of position on the world stage as much as the age recharge and recent the past absolutely and so for the next kind of ten twenty years is really the question how we will see this and relationship between the rest and china develop whose inevitably china will be the larger economy verses t u s and am interesting your busy now mister tromp seems to try to defeat the world order they have established paper impost were war to so there will be lots of interesting kind of side effects that will come em about this development i think or you know the point make arouse important because when i think about the world a boy down into two factors on the foot on the one hand you look at a the fat the fat set the globe across the capital through redford and indirectly by tenure treasuries et cetera and ease that term intersected french all will dry the duller so is the the west really sets thee the cossack capital i look at china and i see china setting the global rate of growth and so the two were hand in hand so eating back to twenty fifteen when china divided his currency in august to that year and it was going through massive capital counts and our reduction so as money pouring out china the currency was dear in his depreciatory rapidly there we did see of aloes spiking markets and by february twenty sixteen china was in a real mass the growth was stalling and they cannot low growth to going go blow through in a five per cent or so so they turned the taps on in massive style and the decree expansion of aremberg four trillion dollars which is about forty three per cent julep in one year he was in beza it was enormous and and uneasily have worked to and it lifted all boat so that in that way he saw the cyclical recoveries on the one hand yet the fed who still means any very lean to trace et cetera but still un tapering but then it was the is china that re stimulated the global economy and lifted all boats now you're in a situation where chinese growth is again stalling which is not surprising giving the fact that china has ruling maximes on dead and that debt is going as having less and less having diminishing returns creaming lessees productive for every dollar of debt and so therefore a huge misalliances they're writ there in trouble again so what do they do they go back to what they always do and they want to stimulate and so the question for mark is right now is whether not china can do another bezuquet doting they can i think i'm sonny's exactly lids i spent i think they they will do anything they can to at least mitigate the slow down but not to have resembles they're the biggest maxime beginning the year with his financial stability was delivering and so therefore you know all they can do as a fiscal response here but just to to really soften the blow but not so where she rustily and were off to the races again oh i get you that you've mentioned markets and i want to move us away from the big picture we got thee the scene now said into how this translates are into markets because we are in this peculiar market at the moment the unloved at buron james where do we go now is there a bubble a that feels it has to be popped arabe at that stage many rigid its you never know where you are in the market cycle till you've got past or i'm so so well trent to guess the impossible but i think i might make my starting point on that is isocrates cometary amen we know when we're like to see comic growth material accelerate from here that suggests were probably late cycle and we look of adoration and then have given what's gone on populate cycle conversely are it's been er er perhaps the onything that surprised me since the philanthropies i is how unenjoyable this bull market has been i yet to see any one particularly enjoy at manning part of that the emotional scars of our eight the wall last with us throughout our careers sadly but equally there hasn't been that sense of animal spirits there hasn't in that sense of excitement that has in that sense of it maybe tis time is different and there won't be the animal spirit that won't be the last era were ye and needed that the the changes is that that debate between am in essaying were in new paradise and whenever you say that i am not a proven wrong and so it isn't only conceivable that we have a aim with it that when we look back in in ten years time why we had a bear market the ants will be the reprinting of assets based on an zero rate forestry baston arm excess entranced y all these other things and will say actually the bar market was so obviously coming because people had taken too much risk tracing yield to chasing returns overhangs and therefore all you saw was a reversion as as rates rose resemble that is entirely conceivable but i think it is also entirely conceivable that we do see am a period of excess momentum in in an area of the market and that's the point at which you know you start calling her a truly of late cycle boom it that that you want to want to derision there is one that i had which is curly you have seen all of froth in the fangs and when i let we can talk at all without talking about matelote fangs my favourite faith ha ha etiam pleased that you hear i ever had a verified your tail but but yet that that momentum in the texas is there am at such a narrow one that that in a way may be mobiles worrit gets any a few stocks but but sonya chilian you can elicit ye know i think yet you so be right and i think that is the reason why it has not been an enjoyable market because it was just a handful of stocks and i think it's very em i don't know whether we have any historic precedence where marked leadership from a riginal sector and stock perspective has been so narrow that m you have without any exposure to those you had no chance whatever to produce what we obviously as an act of manager is is called alfa so there was very little chance to upper orm the broader market to my mind it is a sign that it's a very unhealthy back drop as well bes it tells me that invests are hiding in what has been perceived as can of relative winners it clearly has worked and and we've debated at length you know how is this going to be resolved can we assume and that the either the factor or the style is always in that context we have to mention that value has under performed dramatically and growth quite obvious because if it's round text stalks its tax sector and its dues and it's clear that it can only be a found in engrossing amomum so can we expect you know in the context of the end of psycho assumption that this is going to turn dramatically and i think here we came to the conclusion no it it can only be a negative resolution i e we have to see those segments or the u s the taxation and the fang and the bats i guess i have to include to at least market performer under perform before we then obviously alongside hopefully a new economic psyche see and what then would be a much better value back drop and that more what we have right now but that prevent there there not a classic bubble are they that does not hape around those particular companies there their very successful companies and nothin there would disagree that the hive is not broad enough to make it can of this type of ole kind of expectation at the hall market will m m expand towards the ends of this last hurrah because it's only five stocks can we see them you know i'll perform yes but that the point isn't we haven't talked about opportunities yet and then the eciton that we have as at least said and we should start looking at other areas because there they have been left out so dramatically which is so unusual about this last part of the mark he wrote nearly the interesting thing mary then and and the thing that i haven't complete reconcile in my own head as you've had this am at the last be a recent frater crisis this growth in in a factory stratus smart be distracted as a lot lot of which a minimum volatility man inference et cetera phenomenal way to money going into them a and yet they are almost anti things because yet theoretically those did not low volatility sets me but they are they have a heart of those fine they are but why are they and there in lisle feeling why but but you've got something that is only going up and the the buyers of those strategies to my mind are people who think they are buying things that don't have a lot of positive prizeman and therefore act she would do when her down market and which sequent your question the knows is kind of insistance but yet and therefore action is that that is one of your wrists of dissolution only that causes a cause at their market a crisis is people don't get won't getting from their investments what they thought they were getting and ain't you've got two areas that worry me one is that she people think they've got low volatility low risk stocks arm and maybe of the fangs the other is people who bought what they perceive us safe stopped because they are yielding an income giving an income and at rincon am but actually either that income isn't sustainable or simply their valuations are imposed up so much that this did they sever a risk of capital loss am anna and i am sort you warrior we saw earlier in the end we need i have talked about it a bit the set of capitals of this world and the carillons which becomes that simply were not sustainable business models i hit one of the things that could crack his perceived state safe companies because they had a yield aunt safe cause it was a lack of free caslon behind them so those that the things that war me where do you go in that environment i'm enough make my starting point is an anson alluded to value exponents and i view that to an extent is a bit of a two way that more than sunny does i think that that i think there is a possibility of a changing leadership that says thanks stare under performing other areas of the market the weight money simply irritates into them and that pushes those up and the second point there which pattern is value again extent as in a down market art could be very attractive place to be with inequities and you have to think not just where do i want to be in times of between us it classes but also within and into my mind traditional value arm is is the one area that could be a radically good to a position in an in the current arment a cable will come too positioning am for for this in a potential data what whatever comes next am in a little while but and steve let me come to you with we we've got all these distortions and peculiar behaviour arm in the equity markets what about m in incredibility behaving there and what it what is the transition that you're seeing at the moment well you know the big theme the last years in creditors has been he hunts for yield and thus being perpetrated by a very low intertribal the nita to find some can of the form of firm return and as general come from from neither yield rather than save from duration et cetera and and i think we're getting to a point where now is interstate are going higher as can make it more difficult that in a week still in a very low volatile environments of people are still hunting for field at least for the time being but the mode m we've seen quite brazilians in some markets in particular in years high yield in investment grade and wilson new as i yield because in francis if the reasons are mentioned earlier you as you've seen a the you seem making back on shore in so my supplies has been rosebushes and the supply has been very very long to you as hoy market so i beg actual quite surprised as her residents were as other parts such as a merger market you seen a very large sell off in spreads and is seen quite sharp dissociation in those markets is it postponing the inevitable law in the earth i think so but food beat the key questioned for cried invasion and nevinson in general m is really what happens next sur it's nor me the fed is the catalyst for market ructions in every every cycle ends because the ford overtime and his ariste in a maloka prized in now for the freda we're narrative sent for franz tiger ah we got too high expressing for this year and one and a half next year so if a fellow she continued through and i she deliver on those right heights we can ever fed friend's right closer to three per cent so that cannot be as your hurdled is now can be higher and higher and the questions does this out she pushed the us over the top over the edge does ashe generate procession because you frankly if you look at halstead erm in crosse markets even in bestarred for that matter we've had a very virtuous cycle in the last ten years or so he have had it very low infuses and very low yield so that she made it very easy to refine amidst huge mental liquidity and now his interpreter going higher and the crudities now been drained that hurdle rates more getting get more more difficult for in sovereigns and for culprits to too to refine to the virtuous cycle you know we think about the number is on before companies in the world there there's been greenaway studies looking at him the reason why they're still and on going concern as still as she am trading is that this by virtue very low industries me the bilge the refinements in any other normal circumstance they would contest banco which is usually unproductive because of the provision of very lucius rates and so they're keeping afloat but that can renew for now but that can unwind if you see treasure yells moving home said van's ray moving higher and these can get more more difficult for them to refine than gnats unwinds the virtues cycling to turn into a vicious cycle to that's the they there's already a signaled path em from the fed but there is the risk of central bank a policy mistakes and which the thing we're all scared off but we haven't talked about his inflation which could be on thee on the rise a oil has risen dramatically i am over over the past year i were beginning to see wages rise in the u s and how does that change the done as james said it wage rises a new asinus who have been very subdued up until now but now with labor markets appearing to be quite tight it could be that this my pulling an in a brick on the floor with a elastic bands suddenly nothing happens for a long time as suddenly the year the brick misery rapidly and you know we could see a very sharp spiking wages here and you look at some you look at things as fed surveys and you look at sir the atlanta fed survey of an inflation expectations then it does show that conflans is going to move hirin u s and if that's the case then a third have to act they have to tighten they have to keep progressing with federate hikes and that's the problem is that inclination is indeed in the system and i just am not quite convinced my mind whether or it is because i do think there are some powerful dissipation forces in the global economy as well but if if u s inflation is pushing higher this in a short term the means that the fed will answered no inner they will have to just carry on with the fat detaining the banshee and her federate heights and that i'm afraid could i she let tip the desecrator stipulation and magicians amy i'm clearly am and richard doses from a lot of discussions we've had an that the big warrior about inflation from the fidelity as one of my colliers ning will you'll be right in the end as got a weight arm and of enodoc is that amigos troon n n stevens won the prize for the best analogy in the year from an ability to weldon a but the er inflation is worried to me an invasions a worried because i don't in her eyeteeth a litter the deface factors that we've had over the past ten twenty plate years have have ended and anna and any first writing e m cheap labor as a source is is certainly less secondly i'm and this is the big one to me i don't believe the internes is is as a defamatory and an intimate is a price discovery mechanism and princes have been discovered arms you had a period of affected deface in pact because every one could ascertain the cheapest price for anything and that's ended and a world where that ended a latch your world where we no longer have stick prices or menu cost because of the internet aren't the risk bible can change that material prizes very quickly are the risk is that if an m we heard am agitha from one of the m erections am only this week that i am come to seeing that the siwash to pass through our cost increases which cost increases quite rapidly is crazy to to do that in a rapid cycles are competitors doing it you do it it becomes a vicious cycle of oppressing wage inflation i am saying the risk of inflation getting high is or maturely high from sinforoso the last ten last years and is really there and the central and policy to that is inevitable so a very different a central bank a situation of very different monetary approach sonya ware to the opportunities lie in a market like this i think before identifying opportunities is very important that these adjustment processes will be with us for a long period of time so we have to be very nimble and very mindful that this is not done in a quarter's adjustment you know speaking of emerging markets or so that the immediate reaction function yes can be very short tom but there will be an ongoing re assessment of what extorts are and how we should look and at these in the contact of a potential and final stage of the syce of changing monetary policy and obviously from an equity market spoke perspective this extreme market leadership so that that's kind of the framework we would try to put in place before then starting to sail kate what where do we feel we should start looking for good opportunities and that means to start with all the sectors had have been dramatically left behind and where we feel that actually we have sufficient visibility on the business model the cash the earning stream and where there has not been a massive build up in leverage again so another framework to look at individual companies a quick little chuckles this is where then obviously the dividend yield and would play a different angle because if we look at the importance of the dividend yea then this is well documented over the long term interestingly over the last five years we've had a much larger contribution for multiple expansion than we had from earnin's growth and dividend yield if we agree that because of the changes from cui to cut that will not at least repeat itself than the dividend and the earnings ingrow will be much more important to determine the attractiveness of underlying stocks and that means that if i look at em some of the left behind sectors and again the most important partners do not buy just a year to buy the business model by the earning stream and the cash flow and if that comes with the five per cent dividend yield to my mind is a very good starting proposition because in our own capital markets assumption five per cent is pretty good and say this is what would what we really started to look at and gives you a good idea and on where the opportunities are and you would not be surprised there is quite a few companies in those left behind sectors which i think are now a good starting proposition to look at because they should provide you with more stability in what will be inevitably a much more uncertain environment base as i said and the re assessment and the readjustment process would be with us for quite some time and i says i is not a broad brush approach to his sectors not at all so you might find good companies within for health care you might even find good individual stories and utilities but again be mindful rising interest rates bon proxies sectors left behind her there's lots of things too to capture hence what we've set for it for a number of of months now abase the act of selection is key to your success going forward but hence in not having a good framework on what you're looking for and what you assume is going to be the changing environment will help you guide you and navigate the market bando steve what about fixing come how you readjusting to this what he was your approach when you're looking for the opportunities well i think in fixing communicates pretty simple and then i think the biggest opportune you right now is more in the short duration income type tragedies where in a etretat some of the year the risks from rising yells and and in a behaving the short duration type of an her fund exposure but also he still need the income and thus in a acting for many vests or says would very much a defensive type estra she perill generating sufficient income ter too in a provider though the return the investors require and achang what strates are you deploying now that you weren't a little while ago how things now changing in multis so thin a thing richard am i'd ad not scream expend so far i do think it's time my alpha matters more than better arm and not that into contact one is ahem anything we learnt from o seven was hearing had this weight of money moving to passive or seven masterly dissolution in our eight you do not want to be unpaved ate cycle in the inmost market because the both because returns can become muted but atolls at down turn the last see you want is to own the whole index the second air of alfred had already want focus on his is alternatives and it would be at whether it's long short our equity market neutral et cetera strategies that aren't reliant on a direction in the market general return but instead said relent on skill and of vastly more tractive at this time because they are immune from market changes immune from these environments provided the underlying a managers making her excision and therefore and that reliance on alpha in both both areas is is israel ant i just tenantry out of course there are and what we like to go esoteric better errors of the market beast least seeing or in her social instructor et cetera here is where you can you can ear im investigate peter instance there is a beaten but it's not highly correlated to equities and for again it has provided you some immunity from those traditional asset classes where there are some now natural concerns of this point cycle to time now to move beyond the obvious and in two are a little bit more variety exactly that's a much better effecting it think ye well with wet we coming to the end now it is not to ask him each of you what keeps you up at night it's being this long ample run its being odd and but it hasn't been bad sonya what worries you the complacency that market still showed towards the idea that the room which we had we are facing a regime shift the idea whither we are very am used to the support from central banks and massive amounts of liquidity supporting or lesser classes i think we we have just seen the first inklings of what might be ahead of us and i think we have to be very just aware and a nimble to make sure that we are not missing what might be quite profound shifts in mercantile be very aware james what about you will give you up so am too many things it was the answer richard but bert but specifically in the i think already worries me is his invested dissolution arm and ear what we've seen since the french crisis is at the millennial generation since she not participating mister market they sing it's not for me ah what worries me i'm in in the next bar marquee is those investors which is the majority the that the the population across the world who have participated in this bull market have invested become disillusioned because what they've owned which they perceived a safe or perceived us as it because as lovelier because they thought it was generous income turns out not to be safe as they thought and we know investors have been pushed up the respect from particle and at the older generation who are seeking an income and there is a roves for capital loss and that disillusionment could mean in the next cycle the similes much money on the table does not many people wished her to deploy and monitorial market so that that maybe that's what is in the most that the when we see a bear market am i could have a big psychological impact are maronites for a very long time a king and er steve deliberately come to you last and i noticed at the glass in front of yonder on the table here is half empty or from a fixed income point of view what keeps you up well i am i do like a fixing come therefore by very nature we tend to be more the barsine and i think that sir that the maitres for me and books me up in night is when mentioned only ready this subdued nature of volatility and not only that the implication of that is that when as an estimate we do in a weak dresses or funds on me the funds will assume that the lovelily vimont will persist and so at his wrist therefore till he does bite they could cause an i know everyone's reassertion and to sell every sconces all at once and i think thee and the setting weltering that makes things worse is that the technicals in the market very very difficult to sell because its advice exit or with some of the the counter parties of banks in other words having in a much lower banish tolerance and and therefore they its come is the delikit that they provide to us sin is it can be much less so if we do see the volsci his result of the fedai us over the edge with federal hikes and drainage in little liquidity it could be a very small eider us to get ourselves freezing up well between you i think you've give me enough to worry about to night but i'll take comfort also from the areas at where you all think there are opportunities are in thee in the months to come as we come to the end perhaps of this a great run let me think now stevens had a fixing campus in europe a soyot had he recites and james

09.wav,hello i'm richard edgar and this pod cast is for investment professionals only her her more in the pattern of populations is changing in many places especially the developed world people are having fewer children but their living longer emerging economies have quite another trenton at boom in the under thirties sometimes too many for their countries to find work for you've probably heard all this before it's not a surprise but what did these huge shifts mean for societies and for investors what challenges are there for governments businesses and individuals as we were account how to support or employ the old the young and tidied ourselves were with me in this studio to discuss democratic are three fidelity experts first david buckle head of investment solutions as i am here at fidelity like david part of your job is to think in novel ways about how people can fund their retirement what's the most significant shift that you seem in the way the industry is approaching this oh by far the most significant is the notion of needing to invest in the retirement phase as opposed to cashing out age sixty five and in other words that it does not a dun deal you're going to carry on trying to impose a returns for the many years that many people are retired not in independence we all live too long and and therefore the money doesn't laugh so it needs to grow at least through the first phase of retirement to make sure it lust for the recipe lifetime jolliet well with me also is a portfolio manager and anita venice who runs for denis's democratic and consumer funds now am anita i imagine that both the areas that you cover compliment each other the impact of changing populations and their behaviors what's the most interesting friends that touches both of those while the most interesting and fascinating trend is how people to day in their fiftieth think that they are still yank and how they spend their money so we all talk about aging and we all talk upon the population declining on this pending power declining what i think psychologically people are younger in their minds their younger older in asolando k and i'm completing our line up to day is julian web i am gable head of fidelities work place investing business now julian your responsible for and the pension schemes of some one million and invests all over the world and how are the needs of those members evolving they are certainly change in are in light of what we seen in terms a sort of global democratic soreness i think the most fundamental thing is that people now have their own a responsibility are for their retirements i think the shift is clearly moved from state to either the private individual or indeed their employers i think people are now recognizing they need more support and help to say for an an adequate retirement income so a lot of people having to get their heads reckoned it is not a hat of the people round this table even julian david ananta welcome to you all and because you set the scene for us please what challenges do the democratic and pose in places which are getting older yes there's two big ones the first one is that when you retire you have to fund until they ate the point of your death the longer you live the more the money's got to last that that's the clear driver in democratic and because that face and is actually quite short and in the sense of a lifetime just a few years extra longevity actually mean quite a big impact to that work your savings have to do the second thing is as a question mark about how much the stake can provide with the democratic shift of how many young people are supporting him many old people it's not clear how much pension provision can come from the state in the future so how do the economics and a pin all of this or effect those points they are making and did not helpful actually he earned economic growth these hony people working in how much is each one producing at the population growth of the word is slowing so there less people or less growth in people so we need them to be more productive and with an aging population actually typically that corresponds to a lower productivity as erect pale productivity and is either a symptom that we sink in many economies particularly these urbes colors that are growing older we in detail yet i came well am an it order this sounds very worrying m and yet the democratic fund that you coran looks for the opportunities that these shifts are throughout so you're looking for the good news oh only am really ate some optimism in this surface cutting a case saw the democratic fancies and long online of his inua looking for the good ills and am for us at the most exciting news is the fact that the older people will have to spend money on and physically trying to stay younger and half year longer and this is a very clear trance added the medicine technology there are many companies that are coming up with solutions and the the baby bulmer's retiring baby boers have very high spending power and as i said before the they think they are young they want to enjoy their life and end and untested patterns are shifting from aves from er things which are and may be necessary to things which are may be much more discretionary that allowed them toto to enjoy life an unna stay humpy and unfit so what are the types of things that you're looking for where do you and specifically started of pick up and on those those changing trains so something which as may be very superficial that an sinker companies a big beneficiary of of aging because as as we know or us we hope a skinner products to help us looking younger and and i've seen studies that show er a lady in their fiftieth vices are five times mob products that that that a lady who is in her twenties as of his companions that saline products are quite er quite a clear beneficiary but i really geister if he got the same for men in their fifties and hamlets men in the twentieth you know so we are now talking about the match of sexual men who care upon what they look like a lot actuating asia we are singing caressing demand from manokin and an this is driven partly also by socially the hour you want to project your image and look young and so we are seeing a quite a strong trend on of rover but it snored the baby boomers i think it would be the deed generation of milena's as they get all that he will spend more in moskeeters ing that julian i am going to atone your skin care regime and your arm you're your social media prayers he thought melleha ha ha ha happy you look finger so days if you who were watching her in black and white veneered it emit we've got people who are who were living longer their feeling younger and as netta was explaining what to look younger am there also staying longer i am in work and how are the companies having too am to adapt to an aging workforce ye i think i think in any sancte in lot of value and benefit to employers particularly as yet they am monsignor in age are at their work forces the more experienced by definition they can bring to that our organization and i think you know hiring young talent can be quite challenging into organization so retain in your senior more experienced talent i think is also important so what we've seen are a lot of un at large employers in particular having a much more flexible approach in terms of the know when people or would i expect to be retiring they are designed in their benefit structures in a way that accommodates are an older work force as well so i think employers absolutely understand this however to david's earlier point there probably comes a point in time where the older generation become less productive so equally employers don't want an aged work force that is becoming are less productive so they want to make sure that they are financially secure so they cannot she retire at an appropriate age and not just to have to continue working for income purposes i suppose that's an element of education as well and not just as the companies and but of the employees as well very much so very masaya one of the big big transfer sir we see him particularly in the u s is this concept to finitude welles so i think historically employers of ready focused on retirement savings and making sure that their work forces are adequately catered for for a torment income but i think increasingly whether it's for the older generation or indeed the younger generation this concept of financial well being financial welles beyond retirement and other words beyond retirement saving so whether that's one short term our cash flow death management your families finiteness as well so i see in our employers set up these programmes to inform and engage with their work force on this broad topic of finnish welles the yes and extends into a retaining as wealth and its unlikely given that this is all at the same time as a tecla revolution it's unlikely that people have a single career for this force life span so the likelihood of needing switch gay's mid careers becoming greater and these milestones that are now available for how close are you to a retirement point and you will probably need to check those mile stones at the same time of potentially shifting gear in your career how do we pay as as cut as countries as economies had we and think about paying for people in an their retirement because that has to change his well yes at this the typically three pillars which people lean on than the first is to state the second is the company the third is the individual and the state stepping back in many places yes you just look at sheer numbers and that the number people retiring the number of money on the balance sheet and then it's likely that can have to shift certainly i am as an individual savor plenty for a time and i don't want to rely on that government pieces a significant part of of my retirement here i owe just just quickly and i think i think the state clearly our plays are really really important role in retirement provision particularly for thee are less well off and i think what we see in is this shift from governments focussed on good quality adequate state provision for the lower paid and then for a medium to higher paid individuals put in more emphasis on them to say for their own retirement and become less reliant on the state sorting as quite an important shift but i think in over all this is a fact that actually state do want governments countries do want to back track a little bit on this provision that either by reduce in the absolute amount of ratan income that the state provides or often and increasingly an increase in the age when you become eligible to take those benefits to transfer of responsibility to individuals here but at the same time as a transfer of risk and from the companies that were providing define benefit schemes to defined contribution so there is an awful lot of people to get their heads round is eudore succeeding in in this preparation i a i think is just started in reality and in this move from define benefit guaranteed a retirement income to define contribution is really been evolving over the last twenty years but thine reality is in a lot of the countries in particular the lena that some more mature countries are the actually you know the concept of define benefit is more or less disappeared a lot of people say well that's a negative thing but actually can be positive things so if we bring it back to the democratic changes and the flexibility that the work forces looking for actually having defined contribution can be a significant advantage so f example in retirement we know that i'm yet when you just retire you hope he got your your health you need to enjoy your free time you need more money so you need a higher income at that point in time and then as you become older and actually ulema and probably have less opportunity to im in it enjoy your free time and you need less money and in the third and final sort of cycles leads you and go into a later life you perhaps have less good health and you need health so spider shall ye may help keepin us right and therefore you need more money at the end whereas a defined benefit plan by definition gives you a prestige level of income throughout your retirement o k and and these are the persons in letter that you were talking about it and what how you're trying to a a spot where the opportunities are yes because sweet we see of seen a lot of the developed countries but also some of the much market countries aging quite fast but this aging at this point in time is mostly the baby boomers moving taking of a bit more advanced age that let's not call that old age and it's a time where days they still have a t of saving spanning power and unwillingness to spend and enjoy their life and maybe they are not thinking so far ahead but also this is the population that has a lot of wolf in their houses they have experienced the globes bomb and they have quite a lot of money saved in and in the main asset that they possess soviet the question plunging forward from death for them is when they got into their eighties will they be able to release the equity from the house unused that to pay for their retirement and for therefore for the care that they will need so i think pepine late sixties are not yet so concerned about that the neat taught to actually half savings and made may be dead stepson very responsible on their part because the time flies quite false although that generation that cohort have got assets and this is quite different on two people who are who are following them and and they or also the people who tend to vote i just want to bring in government here am david because a part of the problem in sorting out of some of the fundamentals userti is that be that the electoral cycle is too fast and for anybody really to grasp the nettle and and make some of the painful changes that perhaps am a need need be done yes that's correct yes that lease the cycle of retirement is way longer than the cycle of an election but of course as we get an older and older society they represent a bigger and bigger group that the governments are trant depended to to in votes but i think that the overarching problem here is that the pensions and state pensions as she haven't been around for that long and when they started you received them when you were sixty five and the expected life life expectancy was forty nine though it was really designed for people who unexpectedly lived on to the notion of you retire with still fifteen twenty years of life left and you do cruises and golfing holidays and all those things that was never really planned for from the government's perspective so what is the answer that we we we realize that term things aren't as good any more and am people like you of amir got to work until i made seventeen medicis or beyond but langly we've got to work longer but more important if you are able to save start saving that that's the most important message danaan i think i think and there are particular countries and governments that are a bit more progressive on this welling it well well i think that you cay actually his is done it pretty well because when you talk to a genoa other governments and an insert of policy makers often they are referring back to the uk as a potential model to follow so for example in a indicate we still have very very generous levels of contributions that you can make into a pension plan with full tariff and there are exceptions you note your paid lots of money then in a egeria's back for but the vast majority people these are still on a relative global comparison bases very high lovers are contributions with tax relief i think i'd also say that the government by introducing alton romans has been seen to be very progressive because this is now brought a allotropic into the work place a retirement our environment which they wouldn't have been in prior at to that and then finally i would just say that these days when you retire in the u k you have complete flexibility as to how you wish to receive your income so i think that's had political consensus in the uk all of the plica parties are behind it it is a very long termed strategy by comparison we see other countries who limit the attacked or limit contributions because of the cost to the state here and now rather than taken a longer temper and anita when you're thinking about where to invest do you take that into account you stop looking at i am where you think people are going to have a money to spend in retirement another example at the australia where and they got a well founded a system there is that sort of decision play em a plenty your thinking as i do think about it but i must say it is very hard because an at the end of the day it's about people how people make their choices and most of consumption gloveless a try from wealthy people to most of the portents to invest in consumer facing the businesses is catering to the wealthy people as as as all as we all know they control most of the stock equities day they control most of the housing assets and this is why i think the outlook for their consumption and also for the consumption from the world that they will be passing on to their children is quite healthy the issue is definitely when it comes to to people that have not saved that i'm not planning for the future and this is a majority of the population and and that will have implications for companions that some products that cater to that level population so i do think about it are but an aggregated basis is it doesn't look as bad as it might seem on average kind of peccatis at once again a nice a positive varsities could think she had given an example of some of the countries then that are appealing to you at this broad level so in the democratic fund we are looking at the dependency of ratio and that helps us to identify countries where for the long term the opportunities consumption is very good because the race of those who don't work to those who are in in the working force is as good and stable overtime so these a number of countries yet no musical example india is a very good example in danusia and but most of the countries in the developed world and in japan's kneading the park about a the aging of western european countries is quite fast and obviously the same apprise to trina you was actually has quite a good democratic it its being modelled to it by the untiring policing ah but this contrast has quite decent democratic and and as a result quite a good outlook for consumption but some of the countries that yahia there and the debate emerging markets and immedicable in in asia they are a a different background a different type of place too to invest with different challenges as well as had you had you i'm fact all of those things am in when you are thinking about many years in advance you can look for some pale place like etna which was very young population a country that to day actually benefit from the fact that a lot of the factories are being moved from china where labors becoming too expensive parts result of scarcity of labor in a china to vitam and you can see to the creation of jobs at the low end moving tart or toto to more sophisticated higher value and jobs in as a result what we are saying our companions like on zara going to then opening shops and and unhang a big success as so we think that story played out in many countries before and we can see that happening in the next acari actly so m a a growing middle class or spending em and what have you we've seen it all before david the quest i want to ask you is an the countries that have the democratic dividend at the moment that they've got a bolt of people in the lower age brackets are they simply going to be places with a problem in in years to come in the same way that japan is at the forefoot now and am a developed markets and like carlia germany i am choosing one that about to have a problem in europe he had not yet not necessarily an my personal experience of twenties own products for these differing countries is its more to do with the cultural expectation of how retirement is managed so for example in the western world is very common to have some kind of an litany product which pays you an income through retirement and then when you die the products over whereas in parts of asia where i speak to the response from consumes there is to say no we don't need that much money in retirement because there's an expectation that your family takes care of you but it wouldn't be acceptable to have that and that nest egg disappear on death the idea being that that's then transferred to those that have looked after you as part of your estate so managing the cultural issues tends to be a bigger problem than the the democratic be you referred to for emerging economy verses developed so what are the product that you then have i have thought thought three for those lockers for those ones have just described there something with a lump some bloom payment at the end for example and potentially lower income to retirement to compensate would be more attractive to did some of the ancient countries julian et you think about this from her a global point of view as well and on on the business side yes so and how our employers adapting a particular ones it may be operatin lots of countries yes i mean we are we have we're very much seeing these global at multi national companies wanting to increasingly have aches or consistent common approach to retirement provision and the broadest of the financial provision for their work for so to david's point yet it is very different country by country in terms of state provision ah but actually these employers want more consistency so they want more fairness or equality across all of their work for im i would also add that you know particular u s or based organizations are at she now put in more work force and increasing their work for profile outside of the u s so increasingly they are come into fidelity and asking us for help with solutions in these emerging markets where they are now acting employing quite large and let volume of of employees is it enough out to start bringing about change in those markets perhaps accelerating and some of the developments that m are already happening in a the developed i economise yet i don't think it's can be and a sudden change but what i do know is that governments and states pay close attention to what these motions are doing either often they are in centering these companies to set up businesses in these locations and they watch very closely how they employ their staff and what benefits they provide so i think this will be very much something which will drive change through a these are large companies and their change programmes to live and change into government and two were in an interstate as well so at a government level their taking notice what about the changes at your seeing in the way individuals are able to stop thinking about the way that they save give me set me right at the beginning of you your career it it just seemed so far away at most people don't want to think about i said needn't hear anything that is the reality so i think increasingly both individuals and their employers i given a lot of thought to this and really thinking perhaps talking to somebody an engagement somebody in their early twenties about eight two or even five year time horizon and certainly not a thirty forty year time horizon so for example it may be about there for a short term our cash flow there sort of management of debt increasingly as she student debt on a globule basis is become an an issue often think about it as an issue here in the ucalegon issue in the u s as well and i think increasingly what employs a looking for is what's a simple effective way of engaging with our work force whether it's on a short meeting or long term horizon for their financial well being so as an example and yet we have come up with ansome sort of corps principles of what we called in retirement guide lines and one of these as an example is what we refer to thee an a saving factor so what multiple of your annual salary do you need to save at a particular age to make sure that you can retire on a adequate income so because i'll show that you're on track they am a milestone that you ought you're going to be o k exactly writes if you're in for example your twenties it may be once times your annual salary as a cash equivalent that you need to have already save for your attire if you're in your thirties it may be four times if you in your fifties its probandi be closer to eight or nine times so a very simple way as you say of people just making sure that they remain on track and we can deliver this service and this information in an easy to easy way to act at sof example through a mobile at or on a wet side so the use of technology comes into play because i think increasingly people want just an easy simple intuitive way of access in this information real behaviour of changes then right across the board a fascinating

10.wav,hallo and welcome to the november edition of rich pickings without his acid allocation pocus i am richer editor in chief and to day i've come out for a breath of fresh air after an intense recording we covered briggs it why it masses and why it doesn't china which everyone agreed does matter and whether it's time to buy on the tips or sell at the peaks listen on to find out more well now here with me in the studio are a multi aitin fresh from their month the acid allocation group meetings percival shalt harrington markets only shot at before we delve into investment this month's interesting question what is your favourite word in the english language i quite like the word hippopotamus i like that i catalog to it with charlotte is properly manage at nick peter's neck welcome to rich pickings and what's the word that you hold in highest regard while en say highest regard but i like the word rapscallion rapscallion sounds just what it means yes it does another one i tell you i'd finally jane's bateman she professor of terrors it changes give us your favourite to mars uster but an english peace i i think i will have to go with interregnum both because it is i think quite beautiful word to say but also art is this wonderful concept of two two periods of continuing stability with that instability in between any paradise you'd like to draw it suggested the current british and political situation inspired me to that word but ivan might comment what we may come to that later on in the programme but i thank you all and welcome jinks let's get to the arm to the decisions of the group and how has the position ink of the aselzion group changed or the goodness richard is the positioning has changed so we have something exciting to talk about ivison perhaps the less exciting thing that headline levels we are now new reliquit ies neutral fixed income and neutral cash face needs some explanation your neutral everything we are that neutral the asse classes and i think in it what we have to think about is is one when a period of heightened volatility and therefore actually not having active positions can sometimes be the right thing to do but i think secondly have to position that in an inner inert stead of a trajectory of moves that for a long time we've been underwaist in coming over white cash and actually were in the process of reversing that positioning am so i suspect next month or the month after at some point ulysses overweight fixed income and underwaist and which is gradually moving through neutrality together so this is a partly transitory but it's also a position of safety when you look around you let account was go transitory and prudence combined in prudence says in an interferin of hide to introduce volatility don't take sunny take big positions because hour by hour your position could be caught out quite badly and therefore the timing of any big moves could be painful sir prudence says don't take their positions to make a big move at the moment but it is definitely transitory in the sense that we are moving in a direction saying we're late with at a very late cycle that means increase fixing to kate now what about your region or allocation could you make a change there as well we have richenda one change man an that might seem unperverted to people listening but but we've gone neutral from under weight you came would replace that wither ere underweigh two am europe's you came maintaining the overgrown and why have we done that simply we don't have any insights on break at point one we don't we can debate it forever i will you debate it forever i can assure you is great folly is the topic of the day every day at the moment however do we think we have an unavenged roses the market on unused what can happen and potential outcomes no we don't secondly i think you cannot she construct multiple arguments in which the ugambi could rally from her in one is its cheap but part that for a minute and heartbreak it cacus of its situation currency collapses currency collapse people move into the market market rallies we know there's a lot of money into nature money not moving in not buying in the yucca the moments that could happen conversely a deal is probably a soft but not major rally in the currency there's lot mostly people think all you can look cheap and they move in so i know two reasons why being under weight the ucatella all quite painful in the short tamed term and therefore again as a matter of prudence we neutralized that position conversely we are concerned on warkentin about europe and make my key message when you think about europe as as a region is breaks it almost as a footnote on the problems in europe at the moment you look at italy you of the budget situation ochoa miracle succession you look at the change in our leadership of the easy be coming and all those things really worry us and said there so many reasons why he should be worried about europe that we think the risk for any one of those becoming a at least for a short time a reason for self in cause my sentiment in in europe are high and therefrom under weather seems prudent a kate nick i become to you because you were nodding i with great conviction around thee am the neat mouton each only you can the ear of the knotty edge he started at the maltese vice was it nodding bobadil on the equity side then what i'd been what i've done in my funds very recently is added is that he had to equities vicus sentiment is so over sold that i do wonder whether we could see a rally into the year end jansen tion valuations and if ye if you am look at an situation excluding the u s then the major markets are trading on about thirteen times next year and if grossman perhaps is a biggest if growth is o k reasonable for the next six or twelve months then perhaps she could actually see a rally in equities on the back of those valuations and so i just felt that given the sentiment was so negative this coolin opportunity to make some money and charlotte and you had some differing views on fixed income you weren't happy with the neutral everything on the the the azila's as i guess some of this sort of em depends on your starting position sir sam i've been a little bit more negative on brisk assets ahead of this meeting and little em more positive on on government bone and hadn't ready changed that view i've a lot of sympathy with thee at the point that next raised around a sentiment on a very short time basis being quite old over sold and i would see that is not cut because of where i started from to cover a bit of that short but to still stay underwater because i do you think that er that the great back drop that we're looking at his em is is vulnerable to to slaying again and the ten consigns that were getting certainly from from the models are pretty mixed on a short time basis you're you're inclined to think marcus abounded but a longer term ament am signals that are quite negatives assets and and unsupported offends and james talked quite a bit thereabouts in a breaks it but to what extent his breaks it weighing on the minds of the the group generally do think annie's a max say broadly people are i think it fair to say happy dido not take a strong view because wickens the same flux and i think as this is so changeable an what i say now will probably be outdated by the end of this forecast that said now you're your work with property's terror any and you're thinking about answered to say what what trees may saying in it this dear old no deal or on no breakers how she's thinking matter and sanine's put probabilities on those and an trade around that say at my own sense is that er markets are underestimating the probability of an idea that's not say that i think that no deal is the base case it just says i think the markets are under appreciated it set the question for me a son who has been more negative on on ye caves when you stop to close that short because you think the market has started to appreciate it now we can debate that probably forest this potato here he knows he'll be the premonitory the end of this pocus is all happening as we hear as we sit here and thee in the studio and nic m you have a base case around a brigit so for will not win the clear decisions i think i start with valuations and the uk market dosage i meet for managers that they talk about boats large cap and now smaller cap stocks being as cheap as they seem for years and and therefore odometer may be a reason for her there is but at some point ye stop looking at the upside downside for the particular company of valuation and earnings and then literally pricing in i hisham again but certainly for session levels and and when they start trying in that sort of firm outcome any kind of thing enough enough and and so i don't have a bit i'm neutral but in effie's worse is definitely time to go over way interesting mackay so it so clearly at the front of people's minds here in london breaks it colouring things and but are we in a bit of a bubble as we sit round this table here where early i caught up with george estop lis and porfiry manager nobody base in honor or there is here an under for couple days and he's what he had to say georges we sit here recording this and i can see a teeny screen behind you that's got skies running blanket carriage of a brigit end promised a may is giving a statement to thee yet to the house of commons its consuming attention here in the cane your baste in hong kong how weary the people in asia about break i would have to say a lot less worry than my colleagues in in london and the londoners one had and as of a lengthy tall discussion about brigit i didn't contumacy or than saying that i've been having a little meetings with clients and invests in the past two years all along esoon tongs in the pool than many other places they have never asked me about beets he inserts a very domestic political er is you orsetti that's the way that it's playing out at the moment avon's looking at her have the government to have the stability of the government even but from an investment point of view it could still have ramifications can take could be the sort of trigger that that that might ascend shackaye our own lockers for show i ween the pomace a lot of things i canneloro this is princely one of them that could trigger n m an asse of a cross market that is the possibility we did see that happen on the back of the referendum two years ago so am so yes it can happen but some the way are i would approach and that sort of senorita was to materialize is that i would look at other areas that would have sold off as a result though the will impacted as a result of on bread rascal from the little rascal and acid would cry pretty interesting buying opportunities a cay or a glass half full kalgan on however you said there were lots of other things and that could be a what trigger on a risk of a situation what sort of things should be be worried about and instead of north breaks it more aggressive reconciliation unless especially one that's driven by real roots rising a thing unseen a key elements or thoughtful market worries to day and i guess in idealising in in asia china slow down arm continues we have to keep monitoring and how much so further this goes and to what extent is some sort of her and further is in policy that is a bit more meaningful form for blamore suddenly my glass is half empty again justine very much indeed thank you not charlotte i'd not wish you agreed listening to that with george that and breaks it wasn't meaningful for marcus i think george is definite at glass or fell person i sought slightly wonder whether actually the interpretation of her the fact that agent lines are focused on on the uk is is somewhat part of the issue which is that actually a when things do start to go wrong people people's position is actually much lighter than we think cause we saves that were surrounded by briggs that we think every one's under weight actually some people haven't really thought about it that marchant and maybe that is all still to come i say i'm probably being a bit or more glass half empty though shattering with life is your to day the pointer made it the other day was that are probably the uk and breakfast is not something that scallowa clover investors but actually if the uk had turned and turned around with a a successful deal then the impart that would have had on europe would have been something worth worrying about because populous parties would then have had a a catalyst to rely step up and put pressure on the commission and pulling out of europe and the year own of the implications that would have had for i think it does not lie here move his hostages at that i think that is sir is very difficult to see anybody else wanting to join us time no comment icaria cant james on the china and aspect the affair voorhis it were george's talking about and about the chinese governments willingness to provide stimulus and if and when it's needed how holily is that what you hear he horace ything as a hard one because he trains govern as always been willing too as she was managed the economy and has actually done so quite prudently i think in it might make there are two concerns i have there one is i'm the impact stimulus i whether it actually transmits through effect for your weather our pravity of reasons or transmission ism is as the govern expects whether tries to stimulate an an you see a small impact the second thing that worries me perhaps his vigour is i had given the globe home it contact give the wife to take ten years of expansion i do wonder whether chin is thinking in that the risks to overheat are so much greater and the rist to slow down and transgress still great verses most of the world and is goin to remain it probably dye it how much do they really need to do im if we look at ye still at back yelpers ago that the last five year congress in that the whole message was we want a slow growth and redistribute income more effectually between even a rural they're so early in doing that in it it is so much more to do and that is actually about slowing our great growth so am i'm not as convinced as as some people that the government wants to should take too many steps to to boorish from here i show it and one of your college just come back from a trip to china where he was impressed i think by hove down beat the people were that he spoke yes nay annex at she really great to have had him there and come backers yes i apostasies m and i went from an all his conclusions because i know he's in the midst of writing at all up but am i think broadly as i said of em how how would look at the the chinese data and at an overlaying that with the sentiment that he's come back with is a yes they have a very recent weeks you've seen some stabilization an interstate a but private consumption and real estates is likely slowing and continuing to slay very weakly ourselves about a third of vetoes vehicle sales so it does come back to that can ogleby carse am lay down that we've been talking about and also yet remember that if exports unlikely to soften a little bit as some of these a tariff stopped kicking and that kind of front running fades out say at very hard to call the bottom in chinese great hair i think whether we have got to point of a bitter stabilization which them re accelerates it is i think quite quite possible and i'm going back to it so anne's feelings having having come back from from china and lo the locals and china are very pest mistake in any day they think chinese greatly slowing and that policy makers are not yet in a place that they are ready ready ter to do any kind of big bag similar it might be that sentiment but combined with the perception of the and that the authorities in china that actually feed through into a slow a further slade down in the colony a carder and an ultimately it may be that that there proves a point of which to the policy makers a due to responded a more meaning for warburton fill it were they yet so taking this hours of thee that in individual countries china b u k whatever the lots of reasons to be pessimistic and but james your suit if i'm giving a signals that am i you know when you took him at ouk shares being under vide nicky as well but what are we are we a boy on the dips or a cell are on de peaks lighting as sites a group we haven't agreed that and i think as there are differences between different poems and i think part that might be time horizon and i am not convinced in the next two or three weeks we can see a break out upwards in markets but what does worry me is this this idea that the average profession investor is is bearish and the average profession investor is worrying about and the fat were at the end of the cycle and markets habitans to have lost her ah that people miss out on they can be quite major in terms of upside and here was we have reprint and not take too much risk i am aware that even what i still think is probyn early next year scenario of atlantis and up moving in inequities is is not my base case by any means but it's a possibility and what i don't bet too strongly against a and that would be the moment that you know that it's came over for the cycle there is something that i think is as jane had a very on going to baton he looked back at through history and you eased of a make make some comparisons in one of those could be the the agent crisis whereat she around et c m the fat having started to high their cuttit sanctified basis points and you got tea by the annexes so emma it sir it is very hard to lay out exactly things can happen we have to aware of all these offers that could play out and crudely or thinking your poise to leap whichever way nick and so a thing is very difficult at the maltese but then if you look at certain as at classes there is definitely valise ping bang into as high yield a emerge market dead because when you when you got yields of seven or eight per cent that's a great starting point and with inequities i still like to put japanese equities because there i think there's sir is it he's a good watermark story time your head an interesting idea about hedge funds and how they've been performing and what they might do next yes say so one o things that struck me when you look at the data in october our man has been much talked about his arm had from the longship hands typically had anything that's prorogation equal had a pretty shocking october and why did they have a pretty shocking up to but because what what transpired looking at them is for the last year or two they been very long you attack army the indian names of the sector and so they weren't real in one direction they were taking a big directional bat and they've had a big loss from her then he didn't make that loss back and they not in make that loss back my not having positions on to one or might might my kind of questions is where the organ see a weight of money from from hedge funds throwing itself into an arrow of the market and that demands just pushing it up and i do wonder whether that's going to be a u s value or value or more generally by thing there is at least an error of the market you could jose the slew of money coming in rapidly and came were almost out of time so i'm excited to announce that it now i have time to play hot cakes and hopital what would you buy like a hot cake and would you drop like a hot potato charlotte let's come to you what your hot cakes pies i enter stick with the government von veva i outlined it ere i think that the u s is more likely to slay the next celebrate here yes i know that seuls a head wind but i can ultimately were the alps probably from the due fall in that environment and at the same time you've had an easing and inflation pasture at least at the margin of the back of a pretty significant move in oil and thing that so relatively metric or position at this stage and your hot for potato i hope dates might have been used before but still like it is is short krannon it's a play on that china slay down theme it will so play on the the the weakness that was saying in the semi conductor's space am an sail i quite like that nick your hot cake please so hot cake or will mention her agatha's mentioned financial which is generally generally year clover particular europe and japan look very cheap indeed and that's that that's the attraction is the valuation unloved financial aren't they always assure your hot potato sung again for you stole and just on our work fundamentally looks expensive any signs of the ewes slowing and we'll see the rest on a weakening time to drop the maqua and james your hocks semi hot cakes and a very slightly disagree with nice is is value arm or us have all stocks but i would say ex financial and more financial of the valley trap of the cycle armed in the arrest am so so so that would be not cake am and then hot potato am i think uprise this last time but but it's got to be italy and general and really worried about italy and and the government's tentmate ee enthuse as you could just make it europe i think italian from the italian equities at the moment worried me the most easily keeping us up at night right sir that's estelle snare i hope this has given you an insight into their thinking behind this month's after allocation if you like an what the tale is publishing full on a web side

11.wav,a hello unwelcome to the first and a new series for infidelity international when we tap the brains of our meanest to len what the research is telling them about industries and business is your invest i'm a richer editor in chief and what you can hear in the background it's one of the world's busiest port i'm in hong kong where twenty million shipping containers passed through these docks at quoting port every year in fact three of the world's busiest horse are within a hundred miles of this spot strung along the pearl river delta there are endless rows of metal shipping containers stacks six high and it's a constantly shifting panorama as their loaded and unloaded from the thousand foot ships which sidle up to the dockside the sky is crisscross by giant's blue rains astride the key china is the world's manufacture him and this is how what they make reaches custom as many thousands of miles away in fact ninety per cent of all goods made anywhere travel at some stage and contain ships and their voyages on the world's oceans keep the global economy running that shipping is a big pelican just fifteen of the biggest ships compact more self at dioxide and knighted on oxide than all of the world's cars combine an extraordinary facts and that hasn't gone a notice the u ends international maritime organization is rolling at new laws that will cease forced to cut their emissions dramatically so what does this mean for the industry owens we will pay who benefits what are the consequences no one's yes though well our annalist have thought of some listen on to find out who with me in the studio a jonathan eve senior credit analyst a covering shipping carefully and paul good in senior north america energy annalist and equities welcome to you both and now don't think i came to you first of all for me and some of these numbers i mentioned at thee he started jaw dropping a the pollution that shipping generates is his breast taking in many ways and can you start farcically and explaining the context and in what the shipping e industries meter regulated the in special maritime organization is planning to do about it short for the conduct is that the shipping sector he counts forge seventh end of all demand from the transfer industry but generates spots many ninety per cent of the sectors sulphate emissions incredibly outsize that contribution to aglare the emission of the belting out of a bad stuff into the air that's right so there when fortalice gets into the air it can combine with the moisture in the air and to form the sulphuric acid which will come down as hated rain which can impact plot life in cosden in these the erosion of building materials this kind of thing and although it's proven to have a detrimental impacted on in health is atsu what's the i o suggesting happens at the moment and the amos imposed or limits on solaced of fuel of three offices from the fifth of january twenty twenty they will reduce this limits to thereupon five per cents so that a really big drop is it good to be adhered to internationally because yes it's the iaokanann tonal meriton organization but are some of the countries like a china to put packin am at random that hasn't had a brilliant reputation around a pelican and abbe on board there they are embodies and i expecting the important levels to be relatively hides i believe now that it will be up to the ports ports to enforce these of also ships that are i am not complying with the rules and it won't be able to docket port and altogether a question mark over whether their insurance their ships will hold if they're not combine with the relations so i think that enforcement levels will be high i came paul why the ships use this fuel that is so herrick politian really is been of a dirty secret that when you get a barrel of oil as to go through a refinery and the refinery produces a bunch of stuff that we consumers canoe so it could be gasoline or petals recalled in europe could be desole and then there is some forks that no one really wants so high sulphates if o is it called is one of these products that comes out of refinery that no one really wants and slatted rt sludgy hour it's it is nasty so on the list of unwonted things it's counted therewith ashpit as well comes out a refinery and and goes on roads so's a product that no one really wants it makes it seek it's so cheap in fact that if you took a barrel of oil and could theoretically convert it into a barrel of high sofa it's you'd lose money it is good a negative prophet margin so it is very undesirable and as a result it used in places that no one can complain about it so the other sort of resting stato there is that in petrol the sulphur content is twenty parts vermilion in this high sulphur fuel or marine oil its thirty five thousand parts permian so it's nasty it's horrible at the moment it's used in the middle of the pacific and the atlantic where nuns going to complain so it had been regulated now and how are the shipping companies going to have to adapt to this so i presume a much lower level of an of sulphur in the infield am are the gant use a different fuel or change the ships in the same way that for cars when unloaded fuel was brought in the engines changed just as numbers around this a mean the marine industry uses around three million barrels a day of high self so there are number of choices easiest one is they could cheat ay they could completely ignore the rules and continue burning this ice of a full but then there triscoe of sanction and fines i think what most of them will do is just switched easel which is a lower sulphuret end the other choice that they could have is to install a scrubber on the vessel that basically takes the nosti out of this ice of fuel the issue is is that what has been burnt it it is taking the exhausted about yes i believe it is after thee a more want is burned and and owing to that that's a very imperfect solution as well because often what tends to happen is the salvages gets dropped in the ocean ah so it's not a complete solution to the prodigious canoe mean you can tick the box and say we comply with the rules it so just to and reiterate then you've taken it out of the exhaust fumes that was not going up into the skies and jonathan was willing about ten a acid rain but but you're by passing that step and just putting it straight back into the ocean where presumably a hollowed of forms of ships offer doesn't really help things ye amen that they're different types of technologies he can have closed loop and open loop scrubbing so it depends what calked you got on the vessel brothah realities as at most shipowners you do want spend haas ideally and so in there are question marks at the moment in terms of the exact timing are they cannot be wavers for some arm country some shipowners and ing all this uncertainty is of leading a number of ship owners to cut a hold back and say well look you let's wait till we get there i only point investing in a particular type of scrubber if we don't know whether that that rule is still going to hold in a cup of utenhove yean and i think what a long people doing is there looking at the cost so what is the cost of of buying the more expensive des verses spending many millions dollars on a scrubber on the vessel anchored it at the moment ran a situation whereby you know yes there is some of us from being announced but lots people got a holding back as well and at jonathan and what ye sing in terms the behaviour of the the shipping companies so to agree with port i think the vast majority of keeping company so far and indicated that they will go down the root of burning low toto you the foot projected reason that the tadpole mentioned in this lisburn copecks cost four and stonecrop perhaps the most interesting aspect of the scrubber is actually a few do insoluble yet economics of doing so can all be quite compelling attempt he cost so for example violation that a cover called tiamat so that they burned those eight million tons of fuel per year which is about sixteen thousand tons per year if we multiply that by the derisive french between high and low other fuel and comes through our for million dollars which is in a roughly an average cost of a scrubber so installing a scrubber conically have a very very short pay back period on your investment if you ought to go down at root and i think reason the poor mentioned why companies are resolute more resistant to do that and are defiantly valid but there's a movie is certainly for the first movers in the in adopting scrubbers they could be and quite nice return to be made a horrible either way there's going to be more cost for the shipping companies either against be paying more for more expensive fuel for they are going to have to am a pay at incontestible of capes this sort of thing rarely stops with the company that a vesting an gets passed on somewhere ultimately to people like you and me if our artist mate estimates of costs in region of fourteen sixty billion dollars pay for the shipping companies of complying with these new regulations soubise like the costly forty to sixty elim that's right so there is in north amounts when you consider the operating margins of ship accompanies wordy very low the fuel costs are around fifteen per cent of their rating costs so your increasing those costs by fifty per cent then that curlydown their shipping companies probabilities no longer sustainable right so but if it happened to the industries a hold and preened they can all persecutions are so there what were washing up is all try to do is to pass on the additional cost in fall to their customers which case that we know in by commotions history suggests that it's very difficult for them to do that so i wouldn't expect it to be a full path through but there has to be a satanta pastorate wise the shipping companies not can we make any money in their form not compromise the service or got under water with her cry hugh i won't make any more and at references i that sorry and poll if they do if these shipping companies do or switch to and to ease and it say in a quite significant proportion of the market and what impact would that have on the prose of dis the marine industry uses around three minion bows a day of his offer fuel my estimate is that of that about two million bales a day switches to deal the rest will be a combination of non compliance scrubbers or you could do some mixing with very low self of fuel to get complied fuel so about two manias laving parental diesel demand and put that into perspective the global dease market that the moment is around twenty eight million barrel day market so a two million uplift is quite meaning for represents around five years to underline growth coming all at once now we have these things come for cuts and so what you can do as you can look at the forward curve of the so called easel crack and the crack us means the margin to be made ah if you convert a barrel of oil into a barrel of of product and if you look at the forcus it suggests that this can be around a five dollar per barrel uplift in the diesel cracks are roughly from around twenty dollars a barrel to around twenty five dollars a barrel so that really again quite as significant it's quite meaning for enters there's a flittin of this as well because you also got a high sulpho you'll crack as well and if you look at the fork herd there and it shows the the cost of a barrel of myself a fuel oil falling by round five dollars a bowl i came what we will come to that in it in a minute and but just and again to give me a little bit of context around the impact on a other industries is it fair to say that given all the i mentioned and deal cars at them at the top of this poche and is it fair to say that at a time when demand if from them might be falling this is one way that an these prices could be kept higher yet am in this this should result in higher deza prices there is a debate around for how long will they stay high because knew that the old saying goes that year the cure for high prices as high prices and what tends to happen overtime is that when pricing signals are there market participants respond to those pricing increases so and if the desarts high for a long time even to see more shippers and stall scrubbers you'll see you now some commercial in land transportation might shift to other forms of it might imitate to petal for example abie should result in high deal costs interesting a cake and presumably the rogan be some winners em in in all this is not just the mere that that the scrubber makers i'd love to have that my business god but am the refineries who are adapting to the different and need so and how our companies positioned for for this change is coming down you refiners live in a world of very small margins in you buy the crude you put it through was essentially very complex a teapot and you end up with different types of products coming out of it could be gasoline these all thyself of fuel asphalt whatever and so i can have regard this new regulation has gone a lobbing a great big brick in the pond as it were and they are woke in as loses on thee yon on the refiner refinery side of things so if you are very simple refiner and without much complexity in your refinery you might produce quite a lot of hisself a few oil and your stock you contradict it takes a long time to act and because you have to spend my young capet you might have to install expensive capital equipment and at the moment you knew companies not want to do that since your simple refiner and out of your product stream you produce qualities a few oil you can be a net loser but then you got some complex refiners with all the bells and whistles and the refineries and they can basely take any type of crude and convert it into any type of product and typically those refineries i'm in the u s and so if you're a complex refiner on the gulf coast in the u s what you can actually do as you can buy the discounted high of full oil substitute that force and heavy crew you are getting for maybe from canada put it for your complex of finery and turn it into deal that you can then get a much higher price for so for example the most exposed to finer in the us as a company called valero consent his forecast around six billion of eva door for them this year i calculate that i am a benefit for then in twenty twenty is round formin so another two thirds on on top bobble hole no it's has it quite a big shift for for both of these industries the that the shipping and am the they all companies i am supplying them but when you have any form of big change to a pattern and a model that his work for decade he gets unintended consequences so caius you both to perhaps coast your minds forward to think what might be the unintended consequences of this sort of change so one unexpected consequence is that wears this high sofa you're all goin ago it's not just going to disappear sorning all over night too cheap too cheap and what you will see happen is it will become cheap enough that it can compete in the powdered ay you got a big power generator the complex instead of putting coal or natural gas into that or indeed oil you'll say this isopel really cheap you know i'm going to burn that instead and so for example in the middle east in sandy in particular i believe their making investments so that they can re task their power and industry so it can burn hisself a full that the net result is going to be that all the high sulpicians that in the middle of the pacific and the atlantic can not get about and now gained over land and over populated areas and then perhaps there would be some regulation in ten fifteen years time which had i stopped to look at that again but on it's the oil equipment of wakem we might add it that out and about the detail but but but for the pawin industry that is not a globe regulated industry and so if you middleston government wants to burn particular upper fuel there's no one there to tell me god do it interesting a kay and and johnson was about you am and if anything that you can think of where this might start to distort things in future from my expectin i think the in fact it is can be felt with the and consumer said wilson and high prices the result of this some people have suggested that this could result in a global economic recession because you could you beat everything needs to get transported gloomily everything we consume gets transported so he knew easel prices go from twenty to twenty five dollars a barrel and intimes of the crack that's hired easel prices there's an argument that says also what the refiners will then do is they'll then go max distillate which means they'll try me produce as much dees as they can do set me tis garies gasoline so you could see the gasoline prices go up as well so some people suggest that this could result in higher all prices higher deal prices high petrol prices and low old grind much slower than they were before yet how likely is that in your estimation well i think it's i think it's unlikely as a stand alone event to result in a club like a look down to him but in an environment where you the fed is tightening and where we've got plenty of other things creating instability exactly this sort of well intentioned environment or decision in it could result in high o we will result in higher interest reads high reflection he sound slightly sceptical if you don't only say what would you suggest as an alternative an approach if if not directly this well president trump for example has indicated just last week that he would like a face roll out of these regulations and i think that's unlikely because as soon as you indicate this some kind of a face roll out then companies were made investments and but in if there was a faced roll out over three four years then in a young see such significant moods in dislikes gasoline proces we that that really is quite i am sobering to think about thee yet that the broader economic impact i always like to i if you get was the end of this pocus to think of something positive otherly positive surprises jonathan what's funny for the shipping sectors f i think there could be a a means imposition outcome here so first of all this is a reason ego chance that these new regulations force some older less felician ships and to be scrapped but there'll be no longer comically viable attempts the returns that he'll make so that of the medium term should lead through a higher level of scrapping in industry which should help with the blindman bonds of available capacity should support fragrance in the medium term it's also likely that what's ships she benoist to do when fieldfares as they reduce the speed of their ships could that makes them more fuel efficient its oils slow steaming so this not only helps of few efficiency but it also increases the journey time that takes the ships to go from port porticoed forlong a lion which the husband has a decreasing effect on available pasty which again should support em fragrant so for the ship in sector although i'm expecting in high feel costume in ninety impacts margins over the medium term it should help the support of freight rates which has been one of the problems of the enslaved so not just a major upheaval for the two industries that we focused on but for every consumer in the world with the risk of perhaps trigger ing every session that sir it's hope it doesn't well thank ye both very much indeed for for johnny me jonathan eve a sena credit annis and pole good and sin in north america energy hellenist

12.wav,a hallo and welcome to a new series from fidelity international where we tap the brains of our annalists to learn about the industries and businesses you are investing it has to wear to day the weather now is like a bat's hope my nigel he said at her infidelity and i'm at the smart is ex po in hong kong attack trade fare where you can see everything from the latest in automation to what the internet of things will touch next and of course there's the latest immobile technology almost since smart fons went main stream some ten years ago there's been talk about what shape the next generation of personal technology will take that's known as the form factor mostly what we've had along the way are increment advances to the now ubiquitous sleek rectangular design of that smart phone in your pocket or purse but recent advances in material technology could be about to change all that in fact our annalists think were about to witness the biggest step change in mobile phones since the dawn of the eye fall about a decade ago the other obvious thing that any visitor to this change soil notice is the abundance of chinese technology companies china's tex sector had earned itself something of a reputation in the past decade as a builder of technology mostly developed by others a coffee cat rather than a leader but again that's all so changing china has now positioned itself as a formidable player on the world stage not just in mobile hardware and communications but in a range of associated technologies even in smart fules chinese companies are now jostling to overtake firms like apple and samson for domination of the global market place so a new generation in mobile communications and a new leader of the technology what could all this mean for consumers manufacturers apt developers content providers and investors i asked our annalist on the ground in asia listen on to find out oh with me in the studio here in hong kong is case mc lean and equities covering teck hardware semi conductors in the smartly chain across asia and peter carter and equites to also focuses on tear ware and industrial automation in greater china welcomed both of you casey let's start with the booths themselves and this step change or form factor shift did a i mentioned in the inter what's happening here where with smart fines have been an unprecedented success in the decade or so since ever late billions have been sold and penetration rates gladly have risen quite sharply public quicker than most people expected and day you've reached a point now where what was once a novel innovation has now become pretty pedestrian in a mature market things like increasing the memory size or adding some new features like face idea haven't been enough to get people off their lounges so recently you've saint samson developed the first real form factor change in a long time with her the release of their foldal smart one so folding mobiles aren't entirely a new idea i mean we've had clam shells or footboys that have been around for a long time so tell me what exactly is new and different with these wide significant is that a smart tines become very powerful in fact or the apo now is as powerful as as some of the macos but the form factor itself limits its usefulness is only so much he can do with a small touch screen where is it this evoe fin is i considered the best of both worlds when it's folded you have a a normal smart phone and that she can use in and has all the benefits of portability but when it unfolded like a book you get a far larger screen is about three quarters the size of an ipek which means you can operate modil as at once much like aa a lapp or death top he could also perhaps use functionally like a pen and a if you would depart it with a a portable keyboard it can replace many of the functions that were performed on the laptop yes sir i guess of the last few years we've seen her constant grating in screen sizes as to rise of the tablets and i think her this year at the end of a twenty seventeen and the average green seas without find the half inches and one assistant gets the issue of isabelita say your ability he is your finding any one hand arm and some the glorified fabric quam well they say the idea is that if you can have the ability of a smaller one and then also the screen sides a larger font in a game or is villiers then you get in the benefit of your tablet with the functionary of your small find katy have there been any exist technological advances that of enabled us to get the point of having folding funds or what change that paid the whiteness yet decay technology advancement is what samson calls infinity flex display now sir this pears their own lead display technology with a variety of materials which means that the screen and the tone itself can follow many hundreds of thousands of times the sceptic in me as good a wonder is this not just kind of another game or something that might really come a struggle to gain for action leaving i'm thinking back the things like dougal glass the original local glass and how that never really cut a caught on d'ye see this is is being a bit of flesh in the panther is this really the the paradise shift the game changer i think given it is more of like er an evolution in existing challenges that cannot base bringin your tablet and your mother together two too practice a very successful in their own rights whereas anything like a glass or some funny things er may be solving something with tentatively or tellin right yet or may be a form factor that isn't very use a friendless i think it genuinely meets a consumer need that is out there and is desirable if use genuinely seen people want bigger screens and we've kind of got tea the maxim you can get with just one rigid screen say i think it generally meets a needs and it i'd like to be just the fashion of him that casey would you grew letter yea i think goggles was with a solution waiting for a problem but at the fatale smart fern does made some genuine needs but you haven't said that i don't think ere change happens quickly in the idea industry and identity potable when indifferent if you look at lap top's vices darts it took two decades before laptop overtook deston and i think it a price point which is likely to be fifteen hundred to two thousand dollars the scale initial will be pretty small and samson is expecting about a million units to be sold in in two thousand in nineteen and i think once they collect all the feed back on the hard ware the user experience and how that tar pears with the operating system they will go for more of a four scowl launching in twenty twenty and beyond and also expect all of the major smart finds supplies to have at least one model in the market and by the end of twenty nineteen with far the exception of apple who was probably going to be her slightly behind that schedule katy who are likely to be the winners from this shift then within the smart one echo system are now that you've reached a resemble matures state the market will begin to consolidate you still have about a quarter of smart one soul by the other players which are those other than apple samson and the four major chinese supplies while way shall me open fever i expect at their market chair to shrink drastically and and the market to be consolidated between the that the six big plays but i think the real impact of potable fines is as a general rule big screens means bigs data and says it is a direct correlation between the size of the screen and the amount of data consumed so in the first half of two thousand nineteen muses with a screen size greater than five and a half inches consumed fifty per cent more darted than those with the smallest green under four point seven inches and i think thee the adventitious smart phanes will only accelerate these transistors more use of vida related applications things like you to naples you and even vices like scott but it also extends the disability even further into gaming and given reading of of a books become sir easier and better to use on unfordable phone and then down is even the potential as substitution with flat tops very bullish potentially for till co operators owes it ye that's rot em i think are takes will benefit from the the greater did usage and there's are so interesting statistics the dapple her told ucita there's almost a new perfect correlation between the price of a smart phone and the amount of daughter or the amount of services that music consumes that would be a clear benefit to toko in you know were talking a lot also about the ship from forge to five g how important is that to enabling this kind of form factor shiftless with sorrowful serves a separate the development i guess this is the big question about whether let woolpack benefit as well as whether they can mooie the shift of fight ye say there's been a lot of questions as to what the use cases are for five ge one definite thing is the continued need for more date especially in urban dense areas say you known in capital cities especially in transit is already struggling with with data banian yea for he finds etcetera bars other things consume a usage of data will increase and intended the beneficiaries from that side of things and eve of sego the rise of the often a chinese now quivers like wawa themselves and said he especially thus is the incumbent of a ericson knock they'll be quite interesting trenches what you make of this interest is this china's moment in in the the prominent roll a kind of chinese a smarting companies but also further down the supplying a play in this is this moment where they're got a kind of assume greater leadership rowlin the industry year i think smart folks has been a remarkable success for the chinese industry generally people of regarded china technology eternity companies related to all things technology as being copy cats but i think it the smart finding dusty dive assumed a genuine leadership position and a lot that's to do with it the much vaster designed cycle if you look at the locks of apple or samson their flag ships are released annually whereas the chinese plays have even six months design circles and it means there've been able to iterate with with new features and in many cases have been first to market with her with some features such as the full screen or basileus displays popa camera's jewel or triple cameras as well and and under display finger prints so i think within within the landscape caw has really been the largest beneficiary and adding a large part of their success is due to thee in house technology that they have developed the key part being the a p the application process of which is the brains of the smart fine and if you look at this smart phone industry there is only three browns with their own a p b samson apple and hale and these three companies have commanded a huge proportion of the industry's prophets and ardent that's any coincidence sanchia's is a formidable competitor in the market and in its viewed that way by its piers apple and samson and here i would not be surprised to see them assume the number one global mark could share at some point in the future also aided by the era the moki brand strategy that they're using in various markets pearse i like em a shame which is which is another unique story within the de chinese her echo system it was a company that was only formed in in twenty ten but has already risen to be the fourth or fifth largest supply glibly and they have a slightly differentiated strategy in the tea the talons day sell amazing products at fair prices so essentially you can buy an ephod like product at half the price to the wall ordains if you will hear the warlord of smart fusty will ye yet in some respects an amen the their business model is not based on generating profits from the hardware or from the smart phones but there their plan is to gain profits from the intimate services at nico system that they develop around their hard wet so many ways you see that their hardware being the profits to they generate from that is so the customer acquisition cost to get uses on to there their interned system and so intensive intimate economics is real benefit there to draw back of the limitation of the model is that potentially your users of the intimate services is limited to the owners of the hardware but that's it that's an innovated mode and i do consider expect them to gain of greater markets both in in china and glibly peter what are you seeing i mean would you agree this is is this china's moment or is is that cut of overstating the curd situation it's fair i think them it's not less at a moments like a gradual sheave of seeping very open about the fat they want to move up the tunnel as you carve as a number of chinese companies across the supply chain that started to challenge a historically areas where may be tyrannies or japanese companies were leading a penetrating into the higher supplies so be that in a change in ophel a lens tack and even like beer who do the displays and challenging the tines karenin and japanese display manufacturers say i think it's been a gradual ship but quite constant in terms of chirping italy and from the apparent we will see mention hallway and thar's one of the the leading companies across a number of ethics and in impregnating more broadly there's been a bit of a sea change in the chinese technology landscape think when you're developing netchillik tis a trade off between innovation and and return on investment and historically the u s companies have focused on innovation disruptive innovation in particular and haven't really taken a great view of the revenue or profit generating ability of a disruptive technology at least in the new turn whereas johnny's development have been firmly focussed on revenue the here in the note of revenue but i think their vision is slightly shifting to a longer term vision and he can say this in its evidenced in nade man of aranda their spending now which is a long term investments and have now become the second largest spender in our indeed oll is overtaking the year you and just behind dad the u s certainement twenty per cent of globe or spin and yet its evidence itself in in output that there man of research papers has also risen to second globule again behind the u s with a lot of that decoud be focussed on the computer sciences and the engineering say you can say that that is being translated into reward into into companies and chinas making the push into to memory which is a key component in investor i two devices and they've also made fairly large lips in in the foundry operations and are making huge strides in a eye which is in part melting the software with the hardware and and on that car in astrain particular being such a nice in industry thereon on level pegging with the usin and have potential to be the the globe later in time peter what is it what does it mean for you if chinas emerging as a global leader you know across not just morphine but tekoa ly writ is that what's happening here yees in turns of something network ing equipment and that supply chain evaleen polenta in three gian forty pretty much caught up by the end of the forty cycle and in five g day are spending significance money i think while now that i'm ready to numbers and that you can roughly back about and they spend just as much as knocker in erin combined as about seven million dollars in twenty seventeen say anaitis have heard that they are very much at the leading edge of figlio this time say if they've got a by peonage and also constantine offering then in theory they could take a significant at markethill if allode given the neforis concerns and and this obstetric hina into into the supply chains that probably more lilliston coming intend to components at once sauce as lately as they can wear that ten algy's available and and his various companies down spiting that could benefit from her but that's the fly in ointment there isn't it peter that series of international security concerns were seen at the moment about technology that's made in china do you expect to see more the same there's if i made a rise and concerns especially from the eras in europe and some other countries i guess on the net i criticize because it's so sensitive as a sill of information secure information flying through his networks whether it's from governments or corporate so they're very much concerned about an potential a spying et cetera from his companies i think said he especially given its finds et cetera people might be little but more concerns and that while i already have significant lancashire in europe they basile came along with forging against snipers through locos offering they've tried as best they can to to the suage concerns there's up see any so much they can do an an that's upset like a rest for them but i think from a telephones provided respects of his will in these are very expensive things to build out teleki's networks and if some one can offer you the same potential leading equipment at twenty thirteen discount to your local offerer offerings then it's a very compelling offering and i'm sure they will take assassin sense very seriously but it would defile something or i'll be a combat in the two thing katy how you see things platting up i think security concerns and trade wars generally are increasing in their veracity in raising times and ye don't expect them to waste any time soon but oh i would i like it to eachin in itself is a huge potential market and allotted the tenets are being developed at home with the benefit of a a one point three billion population who are intimate savee and they oughta have huge support from the government which is to the the chagrin of a vues some of the western governments that they also have the benefit of the eve massive work force of engineers in fact i have about five times the graduates that the u s has every year say i i expect the development of the chinese industry to continue regardless of security fairs or trade was and the government says as a real necessity for the economic development longer term and in to that point or speaking two as i see a manager at one of the our chinese taloo pompan last day and i mention that they think in their opinion by twenty twenty over a third of the global five years will be in china say even if they are restricted from some of these markets there's still a huge amount of money available for them in domestic even original they can natly be possible without some of these moments mean so great potential at home if not abroad for the entire chinese sportful in industry and the open comers within it and that shiny rectangle in your pocket or your purse

13.wav,o hallo unwelcome of the december edition of rich pickings fidelities asset allocation pocus i am richard decker editor in chief and he joined me in the heart of a very christmasy looking city of london baubles and fairy lights are everywhere and in keeping with the spirit of the season we have an overflowing stocking of a show for you to day as risk is poked back on the table recessions are put off until twenty twenty one and portfolio managers put their best foot forward to catch what could be the last bull market for a while all wrapped up with a review of the year gone and to look ahead to what twenty nineteen might have in store listen on to find out more with me here in the studio are three of the maltese team all in fine festive form and just hours out of the last acid allocation group meeting of twenty eighteen lets meet them one by one first anna stonie our global economised anna were all now in the christmas spirit so tell me and what do you most look forward to at this time of year ah usually sir christmas shows and this sere in particular i can't wait to see room on the broom which is the musical adaptation of the classic children's story i've read the book many times you run for a treat while sitting opposite anna is bill aquae for fanny manager bill and what about a childhood memory of christmas that stuck with you i i think one of the strongest memories to have is when i was seventy years old i yea i came across a something that was tucked away in my in a cupboard and i thought that is telling me i was going to get a set of golf clubs for my christmas and it was to like the most exciting thing i then realize it is a pattern for knitted golf cob head coffees it's the bit of a come not quite exciting right and completing our line up to day is james baken chief vestment officer of melt asset james i'd like to know what your favourite christmas film is please how well richard am celimene that every high brow hair with our mute christmas carol watched or by myself i'm everything on christmas eve has been fort for many years and i would contend the most faithful of adaptations of dickens and that there is despite the fact it is mostly stirring puppets and who could improve on that it will jelly kings let starts out of the show proper if we may and with the positioning that the group decided on this month and in november of course we learned that you've gone neutral across all assessed what about now in december so am as december we probably had a bit timanyonis a mule inman discussing it so we are now an overweight our equities over with fixed income under weight cash as if he'd changed his big trainers and i think it can reflect say a sense that at twenty nineteen might be like twenty eighteen and we need ter to think of it differently in terms of our positioning and and these two real themes coming through there one is and this real prospect that there is this last leg of the bull market to come and missing out on that could be very painful in terms of missing upside so having had a bit of a set back in equities the idea that were ramping up the position just slightly and and in any regions that we putty favour which will come to i'm sure arm seemed sensible on the other hand in it we could be wrong and if we are wrong we want some fixed income so it is not a time to barbel with cactus in cash given the the tubs of flat returns an old native of templeton return some cash and therefore it seems like the time too also increase our fixed income exposure and tell me whereabouts he just hinted that the that some regions are in favour and some erect absence some alacrity perspective we are still under way to europe real concern their recrosses at the market so focused on breaks its ignoring other risks and then we are over which japan at which we were already but also overweighted modin markets and that's quite interesting as those for two very different reasons but the over which to pan the defensive market under appreciate unloved and you've got a measure market which yon valuation grounds as we like ash across the capital spectrum so equites and debt and that we reading has the general for aerating in twenty nineteen and you still neutral uk are not tempted by the fact that things are bargain basement cheap no anna and had eaten things were the price for a reason and to our mind almost every day perhaps as she probably every hour every minute something happens that were not expecting and the idea that we can out smart the market in that environment which is driven much more by politics than economics or fundamentals jessie's naive and answer to take a position on the uk is to say we know more about rexton what might happen that we do that dinner then our peers when ross in the market and i don't think any one has the edge will let me ask one of your peers here on at bill tell me to his tally with your view up about the ecarte no i'm mad i'm one whose naive fools who moment who thinks that said you case it something though for the moment i i abdera to the valuation of the yuki is unusually depressed i ownership of the uk a similarly unusually depressing we can know why both those says situations i reveal am in tempts of the make up from the market i does a lot of fair exposure in the yuki that's actually nothing to do with the yuk and nothing to do with the duke economy some people as to make as much as each person of revenues in the fifty one hundred arises outside the ukase ah but they the bricks at disco persis so i think that adding a bit of new case but in the midst of all this uncertainty i is actually quite sensible rolled the knife and both of you are ploughing headlong into this unsent so risk his back on the table jibs yes i think risk is back on the table i think think what we've seen is is your periodicity which as we expected throws up some buying opportunities but equally am a time at which you you you'd purely being neutral just doesn't feel active enough to take advantage of the opportunities that are appearing and whether or not you agree on either the two different you case dances it's right to have an opinion a right to be doing something but will let's move now at tanna and gets an the mare a perspective does it make sense that he we got james and bill and risk back on when the headline certainly are full of warnings of impending recessions while certainly had lines some a awful of those warnings and if you read the the things you think we already in the session ah my suspect is it certainly justifiable to and have those warriors because we have a logician in the world de u s set to slow as we entered twenty nineteen and the effects of the fiscal stimulus fade and the moment tightening by its further we have china the second ligs economy slowing with no signs of stabilization for now no signs of big or old style stimulus that could potentially engineer abounds and growth and there our leading indicator which is globe which looks at the number of goble metrics also shows that a gobble growth is likely to continue slowing over the next to the three months so all day some a dazzling to souls suggest a holly from her from our participants here however i can have big however are if you look at the big picture you look at the fundamentals it's relatively clear all it is to me that we are in the late cycle particular in the u s under are certain science in the cyclical and interests and of sectors and certainly or rather sometimes tends to signs in the labour market that the things are cooling down a little bit but these late psycho dynamic can play out for a while will to have actually a lot of police support a from central banks sir and to some piscopal in certain parts and of the world as supporting growth already to support growth in the case of down tons are so actually and i think we're not sir heading intercession of the next of mans or even beyond ah but of course it did it right to be worried unto continuously asserts the risk because there are some indications on if you look at it the yeller which is flat at the moment in fact at there is some at missus bettina eide that the two and the five year and once where it's actually already inverted that's a knotty if it moved between twos and tens then that really would be an indicator that most people would say am suggests going to be a recession wi a historically the yield cave has been a good indicator for recessions and a lot of for such has been done on this am inaccurate fat of some of the original fairs have the mortals accession others that are purely based in this indicator however there is also an argument that it reflects more market expectations rather than actual fundamental so invests are expecting grows to slow but the potentially expecting a recession but it doesn't mean that the recession is coming if it might come because of other reasons and certainly yield cuffs them a flat than some parts are inverted but again its not assign to ours at least that sir an eminent secession is coming not yet build what what about your view on that you've at times over the posture you've been rather more weary than most so am as you look it and indicate is like that the yoke taking comfort from anna's words i am i've got up a particular perspective on this a harvest you greatly see have been more cautious as year i and thee the data has largely gone my way and things have aslan deteriorated and anything's interesting we know however only a yukon signal that is telling his recessions coming the federal reserve of a lamp to tito these dangers arm and i i know that they've already moved there rather stands a bit in in the direction of fir of dogfish ness in the ende of the signals that they been given indeed just the year the the commentary that accompanied their postponement and i i find myself wondering if i with the uka flat and with their small business surveys indicating that the business communities not quite as confident it was some of messages from a major see you survey if we might see a a father move in the direction orfer of gottesheim with markets having discounted a lot of bad news and prices done that could be quite helpful in in the short run that there are the moments in time were things looked bad but palsy a changes and told me that linesmen the tone of a of policy changes in the eight suddenly fields and nawful better than it might actually be well i don't think that we need see a recu for the market to behave as the re expectations of conde if the guidance for two thousand and nineteen i includes a an unalluring the dances of this the famous thoughts then the market might interpret that as effectively a reduction in interest expectation acte as you look at certain things like an unemployment for example and in the states which one it seems to be picking up again and could it actually be with we recording this in the middle of m december were waiting for the last meeting of the effort at this year is it possible that term are game to be confuse it possible that defeat might put off the height that every one i am thinking will come my best case am usuries know that that that is not on the cards and its obvious as possible and things possible our ain is very unlikely i think the nuance of the wording and the tone of anything they say post the meeting very important and i think but biting action itself in terms of a pause is it is a twenty nineteen question or twenty ating question i can't so if no great shocks from i the fetal u s and then anna where else should we be and looking out for afoot for danger signs i think i'm in the items of the cyclical picture there are more morning science in the urrea italy is more definitely going to be in recession of the next year quarters and activating germany has been the heavily disrupted ah by sir policy changes to know the sector and those disruptions serves seem to be long lasting or and also and some treeton and the other issues in terms of external environment and what have alt affected the european date so i think i win you to which very carefully and if i worried about the session this is why we should be looking not the u s for next year and what about housing because it seems a housing or property generally has been at the root of many am a problem in the past is that any see now to waterford while this is the general looking at the globule and balances in thinking and where should we focussing a certain letters be now ariel beryl in house prices in the most countries most about markets outside of the u s since how when we look at valuations they are really of the charts how's the market is is always at the centre it is the transmission mechanism between the real economy and the financial market and that's why we should be looking at it a interesting trader over the past ere air that were seen is the summation in house prices in this countree that didn't see the correction in the globe of financial crisis and continued to er seeing the booms in the house in lordlier so this says sem australian zealand calendar sweet in norway all this conscious already seeing showing prizes on the back of a somerset police specifically targeting to achieve this cooling in the house market and would they be significant enough to rock markets out with those countries well this is what i think we are waiting to see that curtained the intention of the policy makers ah but i think if we see another beak like a big eternal shore hating this countries a dismaying the house market was certainly a propagated shock and exacerbated down turn i came so bill eyes wide open as you stride around putting you risk back on how do you do it what are they what are the air is that an that you're looking at right now as you seek to step back into the markets well i've have spoken already about the yuki arm where i bought some exposure of bought backs and short positions i had in the in the fifty two fifty to thee the more domestically audience and cheapest part of the ukase market i've added some exposure ere in imagine market her and thee the story there revolves around the potential for for the tone of you as manasses change and for that to be reflected in a week of dollar and for this year the image markets have faced a multitude of headwinds arm the transmission of tatoo from the fat around the world is as he had a and has been accompanied by the stronger doll which i had had if both those head winds and begin to obey i i think i'll be very welcome a animating image market so a evaded mixed batelier am i also had some mad short positions in us technology that i added before good timing at the end of the summer arm i've bought back at some of that but i continue to be wary of the second doctor sector i think there are a rare still the meaning for rest for that sake to the are very particular to the industry itself i that have been well reflected in a idiots like caia i'm but much less well reflected in the year seeming conductor stalks in the asses let me come too at james now thinking about im at the regions he esthetes about the overall avocations and changes it and you've just made there but where else should people be looking am at the moment you think in terms of an attractive places to averse from an act which he perspective i think that the thing that we always took by his style at the later months on anna she continued to think that that a pure values great plain ones any country is is is prudent whatever your view on the direction of the market thinking outside of equities and infixed income definite imagine market that definition high yield within the leader and pretty definite not in westman grade still like insect valuation arm in anything that's inflation linked cause are worried about inflation and can do that hedging them the things that commit money and we can't underestimate gold there are times in a cycle where why look at golden thing maybe it just not prudent part of a portfolio this is not one them this is the time my god as a provincial adding and gold a yes i had god for array the last coplas i it's it's not what brilliantly well but it say it's not being a problem and donington brown memory i had now a damsel in your harm but i arii think a going into two thousand nineteen i the environment could be really quite good for gold arm if we see real interest rates for see the dollar fall am if perchance we see in inflations surprise to the outside i think all of those things i would said galled very nicely i came we going to have a a few reflections are on the earth's beam and then some projections for the icons so m and i'll stop with you if i may at what stood out most for you in twenty eighteen no it was mostly interesting for me was that we saw i think the real fust taste all from what title liquidity a globe of liquidity might mean a four markets it was a cross e m but not just then ah not to say the motor market as it sold off we had the crisis and enterin had the crisis in turin it touched the the copper dead market so recently this autumn something that sir has not been vulnerable ah so far and i think this ere this or the symptoms of the same problem and of course we discussed all this armor through the year but i really think this was the first year or when we saw a very good example of what this part of further policeman holds in store for us as worth going back over the notes and for that thank yone and am builded but you are the good the bad the ugly of twenty eighteen am i think intense my own investment stands the good has been the i i've had the shape of it right arm we started two thousand eighteen the consensus was incredibly bullish am europe was supposed to do three sent year and it was the year where array we see paseos on in europe pulsing organization in japan even i and that has draggy to des talking about wrists on the down side arm to way i think being a bit more cautious and a bit more circumspect i when the people were sought mystic in december in january has been has been quaked are attempts of thee the bad i i i had a theme in the yearly partly year that revolved her own energy arm energy was extremely good in the frostola two thousand eaten and at the weed implemented that view my portfolio buying u s geikie principally ah would say was definitely a a a mistake on my part if i bought almost anything else that was tied to the price of energy i'd a done a lot better and why was it why might think that and that you got that it wrong i i think in the u s a investors were enchanted with tenlow and they if if has a desire to have a law of exposure to take knowledge companies as was the case for the past three quarters the money go to come from something is going to come from big santana energy it was novel ded from people's violet because it was something that they thought was even better where is he go to europe good imagine market an energy was exceptionally good very forsaking absolutely and and aunt james wear me we've even took him at the fangs all year haven't we so take not that he really did dominate and markets in the u s and but what for you stands out when you reflect on on two thousan tion en i canna feel richard am twenty eighteens a year where every one knew what was camorak ahm and yet ever undirected baby when it did so we knew we were going to see episcopate ing and act sokiti am we knew games increased fully as vastitude edicts low your hatch we knew the fangs would would at some point stop their endless upward momentum meaning every one in the market knew that and despite that every all of those things were major issues the panic every one and i think that was that was a very interesting arm road testing year i was was doubly interesting as either anyone knows what can happen in twenty nineteen i think those think those certainties that were there in it may be betty that those work those were viable events twenty indians a bit less clear i am only very interesting how the market racks something is not expecting which when if its expecting some of that sight negative it starts packing a great cigarette in too am our thoughts for the coming year and anna what might the unexpected em surprises me the unknown unknowns and what a tramp aside or work we can appetite all hers there and perhaps brags it aside too and if a focus policy officer the general expectation is so central banks will continue a high king or noman polar slowly may be the federal pause but over head and the tightening cycle ah but i was i know one expects that we might be back to pew or some one commendable measures if we do in a head into a a sharper slow down even recession if if we are wrong so i think backward if they've got any ammunition left to spend ah well juggie says they have a lot of tools so we believe him and so that that is something that's unexpected and another another a ricos ta fresco on the discobolus of friend and excellently decide to unleash a big fiscal stimulus that's going to be grates for europe wouldn't it just o k bill what about you with you thinking of as we go into twenty nineteen that might take his by surprise an maybe a long similies too to what you just have from my own fact i think i things of deterred enough in china that there will be more palsy from china arm and drag you talking about don't say so i think the idea that they this tightening in europe is fanciful i i i wonder if we might be surprised or by one a that we do get a polter's and in two thousand nineteen that the politicians deem it a sensible assurance to to do a bit more fiscal to where a to do a bit more manager whatever it themis and that that happens against a boutromet tate liber markets and dare we we get some inflation am and i think i think that would be quite a big shock for market and the implications i would be profound arm using government bonds to haters not working i having exposure to long duration high grosteste bohmer i've just described not working i as a sixty forty passive portfolio are dominated by longer duration high grower stocks and the index arm governor bonds that that could be very very pro strategy in environment i've just described a very disconcerting environment and james was about you because i'm there was an interesting story it on an voices earlier and wondering whether we were going to see and president trump impeach to be going to see him fire a howl from the fed a oil crashing to twenty dollars a barrel that's all sorts that could happen i cannot agree with bill that the inflation is is is taught what it lies on my big concerns and i think more generally how you resolve the embraces ire in terms of returns to assets as trust workers in terms of etowah disparity and all of those are our unusually extreme mantes at some point they have to come back together and anything as you see that re balancing process arm you can see a lot of unexpected things in market soon on its bitter things in policy i think that will be interesting but quite difficult a position for so if i disclose that we don't yet know what our hot cakes or our hot potatoes might be very encouraged johnny good while we're out of time and this is the last rich pickings of the year

14.wav,i am rich deck and this pocus is for investment professionals only to day we're thinking about the world in twenty twenty nine how will we be investing in a decades time hard enough forecasting what's going to happen to morrow so ten years is a very long time and we goin to give it a go what could global markings likie for example the will a world wide recession have reset the economic and corporate clubs what about the world of acid management itself will change in taste and technology affect the way we invest had they even change the way we define investing and what about ourselves how much shifts in social norms in genere quality and other receives around diversity affects our reproaches or joining me in the studio to guide us through these questions and lead us to what i hope will be the sunny uplands of twenty twenty nine are fidelities head of acid management in asia parson and when when landrath senior credit analyst and marty droppin head of research for fixed income or paris first of all when we're looking at the world in twenty twenty nine ten years from there are you a glass half full or a glass half empty person so if we're talking about the real economy a globe in deafening in the in the optimistic camp and there's quite a big conversation out there at the moment that says that we celebrate or extended economic cycle where where very late cycle is a cover the term i hear a lot and that there is a kind of an expectation that a recession is inevitable a and the debate is really around how deep will that recession be whereas i i i look at at many factors within the the globe economy and could see that that she as we look at twenty nineteen and at shefford ten years beyond that we may act she be in an extended period of a growth for for the real economy so that's all right then when when let me come to you an you working credit do you show this an optimistic view about him the economy as we as we go forward well i think the underlying drivers and when i look at the u s or pretty healthy ah not quite so sure about europe i think one may be a out of consensus view i have is that we could see some strong growth in the real economy but have the markets not performed quite as well over the next ten years o king and marty herbert you ought to be looking out for as we approach the twenty the ninth i think that the thing we need to be prepared for is what what does the world look like an a an a low rate environment if we if we need to think about that for the longer term and so rates have clearly risen this year although had backed off a little bit from that but i think given this state of growth and given the outlook for inflation would probably get to be prepared for a lower rate environment for some period of time long enough to take his three to twenty twenty nine well it's that's a long ways off so it's hard to say for that long of a period batard think we we might be in this sort of blissful state where we see a modest amount of growth in in the overall economy and a reasonably low rate environment that oh that'll keep things moving along in an in similar direction i would define so challenge that view i think that there is a m either that this isid that we are going to sustain a kind of low rate environment is very much the kind of the environ that we've been over the last ten years it's it's really the direction we've been in ready in the last of the thirty years we are classically stood of unprepared for what a change in that environment kind of looks like and i think one of things that could take us in that direction is if for example we saw that a tightening of monetary policy actually caused the economy to accelerate and a questions how could that happen that seems a bracelet intuitive perspective but effectively i think that what happened as we continually reduced the price of money is that acted the velocity of money has collapsed for the multiplier effect that people think that you would i incur by a sort of increasing that the sotto of money has not been there so perversely you get to a point where you increased taxes so much at achree that a lower propensity to sutter pay taxes so so you have this almost inverse correlations to tightening monastery policy and opposite that has a positive knock on effect to the profitably of banks banks are prepared to lend again the multiplier effect kind o kickin am and and in those sort of circumstances you end up with inflation that you're not really prepared for but forcibly you were nodding along to this and lusty salaman in't and in edith's is a a well at a big picture you took by the thirty years that if her have been you and as we look forward to the next ten in that big picture sends and do that make sense what were i agree with paris is on a sort of one or two year view a with the taking of military policy i am fully expecting as are many people in increase in volatility we've already seen that in the last few months i think we're in a world where that will contain you i'm in the the other side to that argument is democratic and so with an aging population that the need for for refining of of central bank issue ends that can continue to keep pressure on deficits there's going to be this counterbalancing effect where central banks and others can have to manage down the rates in order to just keep to keep the economy going in away in it to maintain a balance between the cost of debt and the need to revanche at that because eats a very distorted world is a particularly an overthrust and ten years in terms of the money that has gone into the system pumped him there by central banks some are arguing that we need am almost a violent disruption of the status quo and rather than the slow mechanism of arm democratic that you're talking about marty but something much more violent paris to to change thee assiette landscape yes and i think that the disruptive fact that comes into play is that for a very long pair of time it could be the next three or five years i think that the the the central banks will position themselves very much behind the curve ah but there will come a point where if they feel that they are not able to control the economy you end up with a kind of us some step changes for nothing what we should also emphasize is that the types of things that we are talking about you know if they do come to pass will actually benefit a lot of people in the real economy how so because for example you'll get returns to labor the like of which you haven't had for the last word of ten of ten or fifteen years onsets that the equation between the returns to labour verse at that returns to capital will be kind of re ordered and so and added how will that mechanism her happen he what will be the driver for that if you deem if you start to see wages go up in the massive accumulation of a of wealth with the acid owners at that stops to reverse from her and how is that happening well if if it's so let listless took about his starting point at the moment you're looking at most economies most large blocks an whether it's sort of japan would receive even hearing the uk or the u s or europe in a usage point already that unemployment is is is quite like a there's not a lot of slacken in in the inner system so any environment which describes the idea that can of demand surprises on the outside of the next kind of three of three or five years that then then the vow that the moves is going to be a real wages a case that's the that the people sigh of it when when if i turn to you you would see a compression in margins if wages are going up into these companies what would the impact be there because we've had i am companies that have been sustained for a long time they've been able to to carry alone because it does not so much effusion as cheap money keeping them going how would that change i think we will see wage inflation because of thee on the lower slack i'm as well as just political pressure of in several different countries in the u s for example a few years ago on the election of tromp also the rise of burney sanders in my mind is very much sort of you know in line with the populace fervour the populous movement armed those who perhaps lost out over the last twenty to thirty years really coming back to bear on the political landscape this arise in populism in in many many places around around that the world how will they again if you take this and on a tenure view how do you think that might have shaped things and is moost impossible on a question cause it so broad and so long and in in its view but the the teton ic pates are definitely shifting on me yes absolutely but tom you know this can also happen through gradual or peaceful means so as a casco and labor cost due form a major part of the constructor of most companies a mess cost go up and there's more return to the workers as opposed to the shareholders says paris has pointed out and that means that prophet margins are going to go down and a i guess back to my original point i think that could also mean pressure on securities and what about amende primary or york your concern is whether these companies that that you cover are going to be able to honor the young that the debts are they taken on do you get more worried as you look at thee under that the landscape as it as it begins to change certainly anything that reduces cash flow is an issue for credits ah and so for my point of view obvious say with it's a threat ah but at the same time i think we should also recognize that on the way that excess value has been allocated over the last thirty years on the way a more and more has gone to shareholders that's a trantham could perhaps be reversed without necessarily really damaging the underlying corporate was picking up one on when one's comments it is a tangent here and touts or tying in what paris was mentioning his zethus this underlying premise that growth is good and i at the topic i've been reading a little bit about recently in is it necessarily always good and that yet if he boasts a fascinating collet is and saying waterloo think about it in a world of sustainable investing right in the environment and goodine impact on our climate where cold fired power plants are you know increasing that the temperature in the world with the wealthier we are the more we consume and well of the world is that always we can then that set as so growth leads to more you know the need from more power plants alludes to it a move more sort of toxic god thinks put to putting into the environment so what if we end up in a world where i'm in bit conceptual where we decide that we need to reduce the amount of output in that is considered good for the bullies for the greater good of humanity not a bit it's a bit pie in the sky but it is a concept out there and you could see over the next ten years yet with pollution on the rise that this is this is a concept that will become a reality in many countries opere talked bout a different way of measuring a grace perhaps his different way of valuing are things altogether whether its assets or whether it's the way that in economy as sun is developing yes so the whether we look at at the level of organizations or we looked at the level of economies we will have a much deeper sense of balance or looking at things in the round and so whilst i i would neither disagree that in a wit with marty that growths is iii think i we would we are likely to see in admirable condenses of a growth in in india in the economy thith there will be a much greater attenuation to the broader stake holders within within that sort of growth so i think where we're moving from is a world where we had a very singular concert of what good growth was it is an interesting point there is in it that if where youth yours is interesting and so was martie if we're using up the world's resources i wonder in ten years time of the way you value as it might not be based on an our prophet or at whatever the eager that the debit dorama be the same a calculation yes i think i look much mark my theory on this is that i know herbs much more it will be it will be based around the view of duration so if you look at the ear that the fundamental acceleration that were seen in the crater destructive process around for the corporal so he had going from forty fifty years a bouse of twenty or thirty years ago too in a forecast to be a fourteen years and probably lower by the time we get twenty twenty nine then at cedar that there'll be much more attenuation to terminal value than it will be in terms to shorten profits i came women i just wanted to add to am this idea that may be our parmiter's and are changing a may be going forward it's not going to be all about earnings for share or return on equity we are looking at other ways to value companies in a touch you no longer value to them ah but i think that a definitions and praetors are getting a re defined on all different fronts as well for example were re thinking g d p in questioning whether that is the right way to measure growth and sustain ability in an economy that brings us to a next topic catulle which is about the a disruption within acid management itself at marty let me let me come to you do you expect that to continue where wile the industry being in twenty twenty one and yet clear over in a world where these fees are going down the data is more and more plentiful and so that the need to forget what to do with that data how we incorporated in in our analysis is only at the velocity of that is increasing the way clients i look at and look at potentially investing verses the way in unessential will look out at verses and acid owner i think there's a lot of different topics to to discuss there i've eat one of the corwin's that i think is near enderton the fixed income roads how can we continue to in bed a quantitative element to fundamental research more and more and clearly wordy doing that topics like behar finance or r r have entered into them into the scope of thinking in the last number of years and were doing a lot about ourselves but how do we continue to imbed that and we utilize that data had we process it more efficiently in inquiry will always need to meet with management teams and two not yet i try to get a sense of corporate governance it quickly brings in a nest she seemed to it but hadn't we picked but pick up our data that enables us to to look at that even more more in a service way quant beginning to purvey a investment at every level an i suppose every one will be at it as a quant arms race what is in an ear what is quite mean mato not talking about a macro investing here we are looking for changes in minutia about treasury rates and talking about how we can use big data how we can use artificial intelligence to drive better decision making i think were the early stages of that right now a yet we've already embedding nudges and two are our investment platform where perhaps were enabling annalists and port fall managers to look at a wider range of investments just by utilizing the data better i think the more we sort of imbed that in the process the more will keep by it will be a circular a circular benefit to the whole process and you mentioned her fees how will they change and how they're presented to to clemence and you'd bring that up a more efficient and more transparent yet transparency while transplants are given i think clients are demanding it as said owners are demanding it what you know we will have to expose our views a little bit more efficiently and enville bit more quickly i think the fee structures are organ abe compressed in a way that we will have to just make sure that our annalist seems at our poor fellow management teams are just utilizing the dateless can and is taking that idea of transparency when wyn how important do you think that will be to the invests of ten years from now i think it will be particularly important to the up incoming a millennial generation ah by twenty twenty nine is still wound in a form a majority of assets under management am according to the arm to study that'll be something like sixteen per cent but in terms of what importance to them transparency ranks very highly so small a group still but becoming more influential indeed in fact i think their cultural impact is probably going to be bigger than the actual assets want wins your hot pecause they are leading on culture and technology is changing so quickly changing the way that we relate to each other even for the older people like us in this room we are being led by the younger people and in paris and how do you think looking at the industry at home how do you think it might change and is it me as as when when saying its being led by the louder voices of people with different and views or i am imagine lots of from her ideas of it on the economic side of them hating to changing yes so i i have em quite a different view on thinking about the sort of the medium term prospects for the industry and an a big part of that is influenced by you know just remembering that there are very few things in the world of of markets and investments that are constructional in that she things do work in cycles oh ain't she think there could be a very real prospect that we look at the industry in ten years time and as she what we've done is re discover the value of active investment and we discover the value of fundamental analysis now why do i say that will is asking to say you would say that wouldn't you it will let the absolute ears as one buffet was saying never ask a barber if he need a harcourt but i do feel that in the last ten years and particularly in the last five years we've seen a boom in and the types of strategies that really think not about a share or or security as being a part ownership of a business but really as being a kind of a price that correlates with other prices so thinking about things like factor investing or smart beater or outcome orienting investing their not ready interested in and the share as a unit of the underlying company that their actual looking at sort of shares in there unless of a common behavior or canon characteristics so in the sense that that that there sort of one step abstracted from reality and therefore if you are as i was saying earlier in an environment where some of those fundamentals have gone a change more profoundly over the next ten years then you can't live in that world of extra abstraction in a most innovation in finance actually ends up kind of turning in on itself after a period of times i'm always wary about terms like structure like innovative lie in a coming i don't think the disruption i don't think applies to or to our industry as a kind of honors a phrase only we that that thus as quite preferred thoughts and that is it will carry on as it has done now and when we well i mean i think good the clients needs in what they're interested in and what they wanted achieve is going to require more active management and more innovation ah you know if i may use that word and in terms of how we provide that service when we think about baby boomers and you know so many of them retiring and a living longer needing to save more some of them needing to work longer you know they have very specific needs that they need to have filled and then when i think about like the two probably you know largest up in coming groups with millennial jeddaks and then also women and how in other differences and how these groups want to invest their money it's going to take more active management oh if you've taken us to another area that i'd like to cover as well and which is diverse in inclusion because i know that that something that you're a champion of that the concept of divers inclusion is not new but the me too movement seems to have given it very much more urgency how do you think that is going to and be reflected in asian i think that the metro movement is going to have a very lasting impact on business in general ah because what it's done a sort of pulled back the curtain on a power and balances in the work place and i see this a sort of being very much of you now attached to the entire women's movement that kind of erupted at in twenty seventeen with the women's marescot i'm so the way i would talk about this is not to just focus engender diversity but to think about the quality of a management team and whether they are incorporating cognitive divers city and it's not so much that i go in and take a look at the board or take a look at the management team and really analyze it ford no diversity however you can see that when a company is really able to navigate risks well it's because it's got the right combination of people making the decisions there's been a lot of research done about the benefits of cognitive diversity how they it increases prophet margins return on equity i'm generally speaking you have lower leverage a mining simply put richard am in i think that for any company in any instancy organization the environment is getting more complex success factors as we talked about are are getting less homogeneous and hence i think you need in any industry much more the kind of a multi disciplinary mind said and much more connotative diversity in order to succeed also i think that there is a kind of a deeper recognition that given that you need to i am insure that you or attaining any advantage that you can with the lack of diverse means that you are not even mirroring the diversity of your own customers so you know you him you've got that kind of a responsibility as well so i think this is going from something which a bit likely here we talked about with other sustain ability fact as these are things that have been talked about as a kind of nice to have things i think that they're becoming absolutely fundamental says how it feels at the moment casting our minds forward a decade what so the conversation against me having about this and then i haven't a wanted to tie it back into something that we we've all talked about which his transparency a etre he challenge for us that management is to to continue to attract the best talent that we can i whether that be approaching gender diversity racial diversity educational diversity and in transparency is only going to help there i think and he that has to start in schools that has to start fairly early on so if we if we want to either to attract more females more or more of people from different backgrounds and to this industry then we will have to search sartain embrace it within the educational system but i think the more we cannot open that up and show what is that management is then i then i think the more will be able to track the right talent and when when if you think about your companies and the discussions that you're having outside the company m as well as as as within what do you expect to be talking about in ten years time in fact i think if we succeed we won't be talking about it any more it will just be a given and we will be post gender post race is ten years long enough to achieve i think that's a little optimistic but i looking further out on the goal is to not to need to focus so much on this because it it just is a given a briefly paris and what do you think continuous time what so the conversations so it it will be hung very different conversation in ten years time i think the different conversation will be that less of our people might look to doing their entire career in one industry and that there may be a greater propensity for people to do a period of time in our finance appeared of time in soft wear appeared a time in media and these sort of portfolio careers which we can't currently associate with soda much more senior and a people in turn to their late stage of their career they might start much earlier and that may be something as an ogadayn that will have to equip ourselves for it sounds like a very different well in some ways but some constance too so i fleet the best of both awaits us in twenty twenty nine paris thank you very much indeed also to marty and gwen well and thank you for listening good bye this potass is for

15.wav,this pod cast is for investment professionals only her more hollow and welcome to the first fidelity real estate poncas my name is adrian benedict investment director and over the next twenty minutes or say will be talking through the most pressing issues facing the neuchatel estate market and what's going on on the high street and what it means in particular for our landlords for it's worth remembering our landlords are us it's our pinch and schemes that are investing in this asset class in particular another thing will be talking about is disruption and its implications and real estate it is rare that the two words disruption of real estate find a home together in the poncas i'll be talking to mark young mark is the vice chairman of steel investment bank alison pea is the ukase manager hear of fidelity and came poets is our head of research i started by asking him whether you ca property market finds itself o well obvious people are looking at the difficult political situation and the high levels of uncertainty but i think the interesting thing is that if you look at the real estate fundamentals the market doesn't look broken at the moment say we've haven't seen significant increases in unemployment and therefore we haven't seen significant decreases in demand for space in fact if you look at the the the globe will take up numbers for the u k a take up spin above the tenure average both in the office and the logistics an industrial sector this year and that means that in those sects as rents have been stable or in some cases have actually been rising and from an invested perspective we still see plenty of dry powder at targeting european real estate more broadly but london has still been attracting its fair share of that am that capital and investors continue to look at london from a wide range of location so seen big deals done by germans spaniards a money from south career and from hong kong during the year so the fundamentals look o k millar's quite rosy picture given what we might be seeing on the newspapers on the t vee screens is that what you're saying of well on the occupational side things and definitely feel relatively comfortable yes tenants particularly the large shiny office buildings and maybe being a bit more cautious about making a decision to take more space but on the industrial side and this continued demand take up competition from tenants for good quality units of course retailers a whole nother story which is very tough at the moment for arnold fidelities issued some research recently suggesting quite significant mock downs always seeing any of that yet what would ye say as it were on the high street well i know that the headlines from that picked up again some very big numbers it's a mixed picture out there but generally quite negative in particular for shopping centers and owners of shopping centers or finding that it's very difficult to plug the holes when tenants depart and its accumulative effect so you lose some your key footfall tenants and your remainder man am also disappear observing shopping centers are probably of the three sectors of rita warehouse shopping centres in high street the toughest at the moment for landlords if we look at high street retail and were also seeing difficulties there we've got a few small and vacant units in our portfolio which just being realistic about the relating rents and able to get some demand across the peace for that space i think people aren't being molest ic about rents and not being realistic about pricing they get end up at the end of the year and looking forward into two thousand and nineteen with some rubin valuation falls to come read our warehouse i would say is mixed depending on your location so you need to really be focussed on the centres where the trents are trading better save what she talked about tenants affability and hence that ready what you getting into a drive in the various depending upon shopping centers or perhaps cheap pup places where they operate searches reach our warehouses can you elaborate a little bit more intendant let's imagine you've got some capital to to put to work over next six or twelve months the headlines are quite negative errands thinking almost about catching a falling knife if you are forced to where would you put your money into the retaliate if i was forced to than i would be focusing on the retail warehouse set her but looking and perhaps at those locations where the rents earn the region of twenty twenty five pounds a foot rather than significantly high from that because i think that still fordable space for retailers and it works very well for them particularly on click and collect to mark and given your prospect of looking at things from more from them as it were the bigger picture on the listed side of the market houses retailing playing out in your space he will the stop market give them pretty clear indications as as to what it thinks about the retail set of the moment if you look at an how different property comes a trading at the moment in terms of valuation by which the main bank market is a distant led premium to a eneas et vale pecher the three companies who are trading on the biggest discounts to a navy in the listed sector at the moment are all retail property landlords and in ed there all shopping and to landlords am caparison trades at amid forty per cent discount am hamers trades on a bigger discount than that and into is treading on a sixty seven per cent discount to carriage netsek value of course that leads one to debate whether or not on the ship prices correct or whether the least value against which set her prices being compared is wrongly marked and it would seem to me the stop market is saying very loudly to the valuation profession that they do not believe the valuation throughout their fir shopping centers waiters of retail allocation and sit when you're building out a portfolio diversified poor failures and thinking was of islay a lot of investors are got quite sizable possessions is it as simply no longer to be a cool part of a diversified commercial real estate allocation or nothing it is likely to me am i think it does too half to this really it's have you been clever enough not to own shop intent of to day and therefore you've enjoyed that the benefits of that popular location on your performance but then going forward or it can get even worse for those who who do own arm and really any one who can right size their portfolio unto not on retailers an have been far far better shape of the next few years when it comes to bank marking performance only this morning i was glancing say new rivers arm numbers and the other the portfolio yield has drifted a little bit it has been really very very little valuation declined for from them over the last couple of years says there's a lot of pain to be had from owners of retail who had do not have real realistic valuations and i think one of the challenges has been that am a lot of people have brought into the story that the best call the shopping moles the offer her the experience that everyone's been talking about about how that physical retail has to offer experiences are going to hold up their values but i think the reality is that it's going to be very difficult for those am locations to em see their rents stabilized because so many retailers are seeing their profits squeezed and therefore rationalizing their portfolios to only the very best sort best performing stores which means that the rents have to be a fordable again picking up a theme that allison has been vexing on and will be the ones that continue to have occupations i think as there is some real paint come both bait at the prime end of the market as well as the secondary end of the market so perhaps the thought almost fast fording that theme and let see it played out over the next years do you see there being any opportunities with some of this real spaces redundant mark and i think in a short term it's a huge mistake to look a retail property and say can we can we buy this on our honor good valley basis the any time that retail within the next many many years will become good value is when the land valleys have fallen so far that you can buy those buildings and we developed them for residential or some other usage in looking at these things and thinking that you can inject a value retail proposition is moreover a decade chair shuffling and strategy than one which will yield and could return from vestas that's a sobering thought isn't that well i ain't a scree a little bit because i think that the will be retail that will still be an attractive place to shop predicate going to go to a hundred per cent on line shopping ever and people do enjoy the real experts bit scoot right sort of experience it's not going to be a me to town with the same old boring faces whereat she takes you longer to find something in a shop than you can on your your smart tone and so i think the will be locations and as ever we always do this in the real estate market it will be overdone so the will come a point where it becomes very attractive to get back in and putting it back to other allison mark was suggesting is not even started to be done here in the real estate market eh what it's not good be next month or possibly not even next year alicant i do agree that an we will continue to do lots of chopin on the high street or shop intend with ever of that i've no doubt an order in infinite retail penetration ukase low twenties and forecast save again high thirties unto your spot on but we need to think about the valley of retail property in that context with the amount of vacancy and void of supply we have to day and then there will be growing amount of void and vacancy over supply and even though there will be plenty of retail if you wish your operation a given centre and they will be able to drive incredibly hard bargain so the rent hogging to rattle down and down and down because market forces imitate them there and on that basis the capital values of shopping centers to day are still far far too high i guess that's what i'm coming for but when not a million miles apart nolan i think at the end we're going to come to her another thing that should ever a favorite of every one at the moment is that gent you eat we end up with genuinely mixed his schemes so that some of that retail will have to go over to residential some of it will come so perhaps health care type schemes community facilities but it's going to take a lot of a planning also am to support these changes of use and some i think some like authorities already starting to see the need but i think there's there's no tloto erm requirement from local authorities to really understand that those retail values are falling and that they can't rely on retail rateable values to to support their coffers and that to create a sustainable community they too are going to have to be part of this change moving on perhaps there might actually be some places there perhaps less grim than the retail high street and on looking on getting slightly quizzical face as i have to say and perhaps over the ouse where are ye saying vary just now in the you came ore we touched on logistics industrial well her'll top saying where i'm seeing rental growth and i'm seeing a valuation increases and that is in across the board of whether it's warehouse slight industrial or logistics and for most of the years of my career rents never moved in in the industrial sector then we had a period and back in two thousand eight two thousand nine where rents went down and since then there's been a phenomenal grace in and both rental values and also valuation of and the industrial properties in the industrial sector but where that letters to to day is that it's become perfectly normal to pay yields and even in the threes low falls at four industrials based unexpected ample growth and here is where the market will make the same mistake as qualities which is treating all properties equally and really that mental growth is only going to come through at the rates expected for the very best properties so i think by picking your way through the market as it was still good value to be to be had there and a unparticled fan of the london and south east industrial mark is that similar thing to what you sing in the listed market logistics commanding better pricing certainly the companies we talk to arm in valden logistics continued to be very enthusiastic about them but i would echo what allison is saying that that does a price for everything and we may be reaching piping pricing am said so what one need to be careful there that they clearly the ever shrinking supply of of london an urban aloetic space on it is a something which is it is worth tracking other areas postmark to think about the first one i might say which might surprise if of every listener is actually the city office market do you think with a engaging all around as when one should be nerves of the city of his market that um we ourselves right here looking for space at the moment arm we want some here even fifty thousand square feet and done it's beginning to look like it it might be a bit of a landlord's market there is not much new space at there and causes a few towers but if you don't want to be in a tower there are not many options so that that an entry market too to think about elsewhere ready be mentioned health can is the sector that we continue to like and theatrically we typic ates evil have liked and focused on sectors of recent years which cannot be disrupted are not disrupted by the internet health caresses would be one nice residential a lovely places to live is another retail is clearly not comfy any thoughts of that yes i think i think that there are scanty some big themes the am change the way that property is used used over the next ten fifteen years and i think the to indite industrial rope the fourth industrial revolution i think is the the interesting one and how we use offices and what sort of a requirements there will be for office space i had not been talked about about that we work phenomenon and and how that's revolutionize in things are not entirely convinced that it that its wee work that's important in this story but the ways we work on the way particularly the millennial generation wants to work may mean the officers need to be used in a different way and technology needs to be brought into the way that we manage office space and occupy off his space in her and in a smarter way and will change perhaps the fundamentals of what a good good office looks like an the other things there i think a big themes for the next five to ten years or the democratic theme which again goes back sir thoughts about health care thoughts about housing and how that's going to change em in particular there's been a lot of talk about how millennial don't want to own things any more so perhaps a shift away from ownership of housing to rental out rental housing and how that might change what our housing stock looks like and for folk for fit for purpose rentals and certain that those are those again to be big changes that perhaps influence what portfolios looked like in ten years time there will be a move away from just the straight three classic retail office industrials to take in some of these changes in the way that people are living and the way the people are working perhaps came you'd like to buy someting for antony tolls and his famous novel and paraphrase it to the way we work now rather than be lived not thank you for that moment a alison her just bringing you on that ere kim's clay thought about some quite big thematic changes they are likely to be deriving to it how we use our current space whether is where we live where we work and so forth but from your perspective as an investor his trainer deliver a real estate explosion consequently at real estate return has quite profound changes pickers i presume all you've ever had to ready deal with his investing in retail office an industrial in a previous life our lot of experiencing a student halls and other type of a social housing i think it is important to remember that our job is and providing space to people who want to pay a rent on it whatever that space is and certainly on the in terms of thee and that the fourth industrial revolution and we have seen across our whole portfolio our own tenants putting forward proposals for fit out as they've changed as they've matured as they've developed their ways of working in their offices and its typically reducing the amount of space that they want at bringing him more hot dusking much more working from home a mean even fidelities doing that now for its office move so i think oh we've seen the changes happening though space requires reducing and i think it makes a lot of sense to think about different sectors where you have got that long term income mean your best ultimate match for something that sir a pension fund in terms of investment should probably be something that's more in the residential santa we talked about disruption we talked about the reader were prey much talked by everything but belly mentioned breakin his bricks are even a concern ra i'll go first on this wrong wickes m a sais honestly a topic where and we start off by saying no one knows exactly what it is yet and i'm much sure whether we will next year either aye aye at she think that the structural changes so of the moved on my retailing the change in the ways working and the change in the ways were living are more important changes over the next three five years in terms of the performance impact and above beyond that certainly what we saw when er there was the breakin vote and post that the currency is a key driver of underlying performance of assets in the u k were very open too for an investment and those those flowing we turn on and off dependent on at the position the currency now i grieve talisman the currency question is an important one and it's not simply about breck set i think as we've seen a constipating on winding and cutie happening in in the u s a that divergence and interest rates is going to start meaning that the currencies move around a lot more and that they could have a big influence on investment into the eucharist europe ove the next two to three years which is which breakin just makes more difficult to judge because it creates that additional uncertainty too but i think that those those transient interest rates are going to have a big influence on what happens and those against me again more important than the a political issues that were facing with breakstone so much breaks it related uncertainty there at the moment that i have no doubt that stop market will lurch downwards and upwards a lot in the coming month on the back of what appeared to be certainties that haven't been faced in but dell were covered quickly as well as the stomach in gets used to a new doom and lastly looking forward to can each go and get your crystal balls out now i what do you see is being the most significant change to investigations to you cave real estate market kim o i think it is going to be this steady change in allocation away from the traditional sectors i think we will yet people will focus on income but they'll look at where that where else they can get income other than the commercial sectors i agree with him pelican to be increasing their other sceptre is already around about ten cent of the average and portfolio and things like student halls hotels care homes and the like nothing that will continue to increase in part driven by the fact that quite often they'll offer some indexing key along the leases i'm go briny agree as well that in investors need to have that their faces pressed very hard against the window of reality and understand that a retail valleys will decline sustainable for a long time and that is going to massively reduced retail allegations one

16.wav,a hallo and welcome to the first edition in twenty nineteen of rich pickings fidelities acid allocation porthos i am richard eke at his own chief and joined the gentle babble of the fountain outside the london stock exchange in contrast to invested we've been picking themselves up and dusting themselves down after the turmoil at the end of twenty eighteen in this episode we take a closer look at exactly where markets find themselves with a brief detouring to the brakes it doldrums and what key the moon music is written in that port failure manages around the world a having longed to certainly it's not as discordant as you might expect listen on to find out more with me in the studio three of the miltitz pack from the christmas break and already up to their elbows in the markets and going round the table first to an asterisk head of glober macro and investments dressed you know and we always start with our probing personal question to intrigue at all and i'd like to know what the most obscure food that you have tried i'm going to give you two things because i i aid that at the same time during samuel and that was chicken feet and dark tongues not obscure in certain parts of world is activities yoor year katrine i also as we have pooterage deputed him nick welcome at what oddities have you dined on a few for the one that stands out was on a trip to vina many many years ago wi developed to love for foe a soup and the most to have cow intestine nightlong point sounds delicious were recording with early in the morning and i can feel my appetite rising at finally james baken chief investment officer of maltese james welcome to you are you a fussy eater or an adventurous one oh i think my my innate conservatism with her investing in anpu is probably reasonably and similar richard but i would i would say that pretty the most interesting thing i etons is a prawn brain on a bed of fried her brown feet from legs i noted eat that with neck ache in japan once when we're on a business trip well aunt aunt james you are what you eat of course so i'm aglae got that sort about to get us out going with the program proper er james can tell us what positioning at the group i had decided for january and what changes they have been in particular of course richard so enters the main position in no change are ye overweight equities over weight fixed income underway gash within the only really one nuance of change which is we have moved over weight you associates that areas me controversial move within the team and faremont it what i would say is were not ready seen by the urus market for much more saying there are areas of the rest market that look too attractive not to be over which in the more valuer as there i haven't really moved much of the last eighteen twenty four months where we see upside were equally limited downside though risen yes answered kulak well a quick interlude in asiatic discussion to bring in the ugly myth that is brings it but according this portas the morning after the night before when promiser teresa me suffered an historic defeat on the deal she negotiated with the european but before a vote of confidence in her government at this jew this evening now not an awful loss has happened in markets overnight but james it does this change anything or as to esmee herself might say nothing has changed well adamant to borrow the pre ministers words or shutter the current premier's words i adore will be animated to day but but but look i think in reality everything is panned out in limit expectations and there was no way this deal was can be voted through and at this point a the market is sanguine because that was completely in limit expectations and acting the magnitude of the devitt defeat is broadly irrelevant in terms of a practical implications adding also that that the meteor clearly loved her to hide her up as being the biggest parliamentary to feat in history courier lot more impede and their forelocks could potentially rebel than we've had in history so it's not a very apparel will he give us most twenty for the mathematical analysis sir that you upsetting me and i watched it for a year last night and being a historian at heart so so that you know on that that prospective its expectations and actually trees a may cole precipitated and wanted eveena confidence at that point so this is in line with whatever strategy we might think she has a usial as expected anna if i could come back to the a g discussion that we had and this week that you are hoisted and the ukase didn't get a mention not even once and is it just an irrelevance in investment terms until brigit has been resolved to await the other i don't think so am in the sense that do we have obviously augusta purloin politic sir a sincere friend and that ethan is all has driven market particularly the pound but after very strongly about not losing sight of fundamentals am and i think from a longer and perspective and we are long to modeste's i'm atin the way to think about the outcome for the k would be in terms of the social production function what effects the congress of the economy ah how exhibit going i'd exhibit against capital and labour which am a nick if i come to you who's going to be putting capital into the kat the moment when it's so bleary and vague as to what what direction the country is taken yes that's that's a very diffuse very easy question to answer not many feet race fat and from an investment perspective i'd argue that at the yokes look very cheap now and all i have been adding very slowly i wouldn't admit it the jib that hero ellery hear is savor exactly it safe at this effort if you look at domestically focussed uk equity stocks they are trading on single digit peas and very close to historic clothes save from for my perspective that a great place to start if i see i've got no idea what can happen ultimately but when you go etiquette is not an it's a good place to start if i have everything of setting that indeed i was i always worry about investing colon valuation basis and because we come back to sir pincushion numeral dead and yet it will come right that mary too long i think i think nick has a point here and i are him the point is that when we look at the arm the behaviour of none new cay outside of yucatan vestures there has been virtue no purchasing of cavities for a lengthy period and that money on the side lands and at some point there will be a trigger that brings it back in and that only to a reasoning sharp i suspect my rating of ukases so i think it has as a dispassionate vest to the factor in the yuccas mister elephant here as a dispassionate investor its very treliss and very raptly valued and stocks for love very factory rostock and you can see that there's been a technical faction toms of lack of demand for them that at some points like to revert so it does seem a mantrap to be at the margin increasing unfashionable better but perhaps an interesting place to me resting where the debate kicks off again this afternoon after promise her questions and then astonishingly a debate on a private member's bill which would bound post boxes for being built too close to the ground i for one shall be good to the box now beyond brigitte breathe i relief but if he'd been looking at the data it's been a pretty miserable start to the ear what does twenty nineteen hold will discuss it high studio in a minute but first i caught up with research amnesty and samson who puts together for denise's own leading indicator in thanks for taking the time to talk her now i you produce the fly fidelis leading indicator every moment and is making pretty miserable reading do you want explain what's gone on this month and just how bad it is if you look back historic certainly well this month if housenlager has moved even further into the balsam left of its psyche tracker which is precisely where you don't want to be it means growth heading below trends and also decelerating in fact it house consisted with growth heading to the lowest level roused to train since two thousand eleven thousand twelve which i am mosusa will remember was not a particularly a happy time and willy the key driver this month as increment averseness even though a across the board signals argues that the reeling transl driver has been globe trade data other than wearing signs for for quite a while but really the the death knell has come from china over the past two months were trades day has been very weak death knell oh that's this serious languished be a oddly for death relatively short lives and let me explain why and what you saw was a large and front loading facility ahead off the proposed escalator in new eschine tariffs on january the first and november was really the the dead lines to get your shipping out and so supply chains had been working in overtime to get this trade all done in time of course that those tarts whenever icy implemented but still the the panic buying in advance of course some beaded things in yes and while at least october and then you saw some pay backing ever and even more pay back over the past months and now i think there's more to it than just that that point is over states the weakness at the impact can't be here for some time and there's other reasons to be negative on both global trays over the next thet six months a but also just glowing as the fly would suggest so in summary a your forecast based on or the fly basin all the data that's going in to make up that picture and is that at the beginning of twenty nineteen is gently pretty weak yes clodagh since he will contain to soften from in some places already quite a weak a place at the end of twenty eighteen any a succour that we can draw from at the date at all so after a very weak run in german industrial data at the end of sir the yerl very grisly in in europe and when saracens tive blossoming outs and if that continues sir i would really help as that based on demand within europe or coming from asia certainly the weakness seen earlier in the year was as a result of asia and emerging markets slowing in particular a but in fact the ouse resilient might be result ive a the years of naturally holding up domestically a little but base right back in the studio am anna it sounds and looks pretty dreadful but you're still confident that when not heading into a recession at least not not yet i think it depends what country you look out there is a lot of toreador about her a almost an imminent secession uniting the probity that it is very low yes we're seeing slow down as from a very high and sustainable rates of growth to somewhere perhaps around tranto one point eight two per cent growth in the u s a butter add the economist to pretty strong a thing the consumer has the support from setting labor market and the er poster rial wages the saving street is high and there is definitely room for adjustment on the consumers side so he seemed manufacturing slow down in the states but your saying it's the consumer which is that makes up the bulk of the economy there that serve as one keeping sticking on a consumption makes up a seventy per cent of the grossest products in the us so it's very important if you remember making twenty fifteen manufacturing was essentially in recession but the economist still delivered positive rate of growth because of consumer and genius your supposition the earth you must be you he just got er long will the team have now collected suiting fully collected manic for collective n n n n e and incomes to cover things one is every one always and underestimates the results of the ears economy arm and the rest the earth consumers no what ever two i think i trump worries about the market we know that he may have taken his mind off it for a while he may have folk started fixing on other things but the reality is trump doesn't want a protracted bear market he wants a bull market and therefore at some point something more positive is going to come out of the white house that supports markets probably and there what you beddin two pretty major things that prevent the us and consumer an an tromp in terms of usurpation if you're not long at the moment but trump hasn't actually achieve a lot of things that he once like a wall for example sir you you're bewailed o faces is that something like something are easier than others and i think added that the reality is further tax cuts arms his catchings are either to things are massively stimulative actually he could announce them for something happening tears out that would push markets at markets we remark be positive and they could not reverse before they actually come through so who knows but that it has a lot of options on the table for him yes and thank ye jones that's a very positive view of the u s which brings me to nick you're not positive on newest why not like why have you stuck with a m a a negative ye on untuned to say so to my mind as for so this is a relative game for us and i just find markets outside of the u s far more attractive than the uses itself to the yeast market we were nose very expensive in terms of ratings valuation or voice enow on fifteen sixteen times compared to the end of last year and those of keith's two to three last year but if i look at other areas such as i mentioned the ucalegon markets where i'm overweight the writings they are far more tractive and i also think that sam in every ever weakening dollar than that can be supported for errors like er emerging arcus as well says it's it's not as if i didn't like it the u s and you are einstein that they shouldn't take it that it nobody had a hand and they should take offence of his sister are more traceries elsewhere once and i can come to europe because and that seems a bit of a risky bet at the moment and amid the c b doesn't have an awful lot of fire pear left of it ah no oh although that's not what they would admit but i think er none of us would want to be in jaggs shoes right now i'm an t may harry he doesn't have got much longer he have just two am extend my answer to your question about recession that that's where i worry i will wort the recession in the urrea and the risks of that a much much much higher than in the s and now it's true that sir domestic demander still strong and even mentioned it briefly but i think the deterring the external side is still quite significant driven by the china cyclades clearly showing upper in the day particularly in germany some of it is driven by one of factors such as sir regulation in altereth are but most of it i think is due to the continual situation in the external cycle that will ultimately stand stealing into the domestic data because the one of the grass that term was discussed at the a g with on the automobile manufacturing in germany and it was shocking an absolute plummeting and its noggin is not just because of the changes sir to regulation it is the demand from china which is really key ah where does this leave thee i c as you say are not many options of course they can go back to the old tool sir or detestation key perhaps the flowing tomes of firm interstate has not probably been tested as we can go lowell delora minus forty basis points but i do think at some point they should at least that's what a thinker should do athena what they might do and is to put more pressure on the governments they have created the marmont in which and the government sir didn't you have to worry about supporting their economy so unsaying to government a we've done arabian with the with with monetary policy it over to you with fiscal a stimulus and that you need to take the pain for this yes he's acland montepulciano asiki ah but it should really work together with fiscal and together with structural policy to which you better growth out comes am and i think it now it's really down to governments to do that er now the path there will not be smooth for sure ah but i think ultimately it's going to be a much more effective move from the city which is quite a complex picture around the world in werowocomoco things are are going an for sure but to get her a clearer sense of hooroo managers not just here it fidelity but beyond a thinking at the moment i spoke to recalls he meets raggedy with a wide range of fundamentals in ancient emerging rockets to analyze their perforated views and he spotted some interesting transactions salaried then the mood of the people that you've been talking to because i know the headlines looked so miserable and yet oh that's not what you've been picking up in asia and the magi markets equites at the very margin the mood is to increase risk in in portfolios there's been a big correction in the changes equites into thousand eighteen ah it was the communion and a couple of factors a strong dollar on one side and then train wars and also most importantly and domestic slow down in china and all the originals sling to china but that none of that's change it's all looking pretty miserable but your saying that i some of their pens are ready to take on risk again there to sing the upside yes rich are so in order to make money in england markets skilling ascertain to distinguish one need understand what's factor in prizes so that's very important if market prices are already discounting a slow down that is so that we be already baked into the prices so ah chances our death that we have seen the worst in the intimacies and just as are bad going forward women as estein and the natick so there's the time to buy but you say this is just at the margin and when i say the margin i mean the direction of trouble has been to increase risks so i couple ova value investors in asia ah they were already over weight trying offer for example by no ten per cent or so they moved from ten to five and they have reduced cash from seven eight down to two actually one value a investor in asia is actually reopen his own strategy to existing vests so because he wanted to deploy more capital because the rising abundance of venetian ideas there not only the cash in the fun came down by the also he opened the falling that's quite a strong signal that tells as the opportunities at this ah is quite good now in china and meaning vessels are i've been a talking about our ears downgrade or his own grades they see them coming but if they are and we now between three and four per cent betray baked into the price i think they are more in the camp of a ye mind slow down no more no more than a mild slower not more than that little pretty encouraging his notes it is richard one of things that was interest us with active managers is is how they use cash on a messenia active managers in cash because i think they're paid to be invested not to not to keep money on the side lines and but none the less am some due vary their cashala a lot and it's a reasonably good indicator of of short medium term a like the market moves arming cashmeres up and down and you are seeing this general moves recollective of cash being deployed into new ideas i know nick talked about motor martially recorded was in a motor pockets is an area we from le as a team stood have a complete consensus on much as the u s y i'm at mobilised of of a m simplon valuation grandson and indeed i think the acting managers are reflecting that very effectually which is that there are a lot of stocks that are very attractively priced and almost price for it for for an economic recession that is particularly likely to come soon sat in many people central cases yes i am here that there is material stock level upside arm which jests were not really then at the cycle at the moment and a nick as a portfolio manager of portfolio manages that does what recorder and was saying to set the that time with your indies i be absolute an it's and he said it further fete is said the margin but to me there is a significant move away from the styles that were investing we saw last year particularly great style and managers are now moving more towards looking at valued style of holston cyclical financial because that's where they think the next relative rum relative performance will come but cause the de fang stocks the tex stocks they took a real tumble at the end of the year and that let some of the steam out of the markis that was a relief rarely that kicked him but anna at some point the markets will take a closer look at your estate to what what happens then we i think the markets have started looking at the data and there was sir this feeling that and the growth was strong and that this can last for a long time and then at end of last year and wise at seeing the fossils of the soul so down under in particular that the latest i peer my this is a matter of business confidence in the wars for december i showed a quite a significant drop under that spoke the markets to some extent so absolutely markets already focus saying are on the data on on the fat of course is always one on the shifter to modish stands recently and but in i do think that ah there is too much fear a price in about recession am an then that's why i think perhaps the markets and it will take a bit of time but but the market will realize that actaeon my is still on the relatively stronger footing at least for these very very late stage of the cycles him we've got the earnings i season coming up as well says cannot be very interesting to do tell the top down data that we kept with what companies the saying true management were confiture about results for two thousand eighteen but it brought the manager talk about in tones of the outlook i i think that's all i can have a significant bearing on market direction for the next few reals genoa well we are now out of time which means it's time to play hot cakes and poppets what would you buy like a hot cake what would you drop like a hot potato at anna let me come to you first fall your hot cakes place i like the japanese year and i think a fundamental a supportive for valuation is also supportive but most importantly it has a de desave heaven characteristics that would just be good to have en in any performer's right now i i like that perhaps as is the yours dollar and my head potato is some a yours treasures a perhaps a little bit while controversial but day again given my ovens and on the fat i thing yields our way too low for weather economies and forbear the fact or might be in a few months time ah so i would term i would choose that as man i thank you very much a nick your hot cakes ah for my hot cake given i've had ter james's support only go for ye k equities and when i see her income finds or dividend funds paying out yielding north of seven per cent that to muse a great starting point so and that's where i thought it would be annual hot potato was bit more tricky at you because i don't see there are too many areas you effect is aside for the too expensive so voted for the oidor ah where models are suggesting fundamentally expensive and the economy is struggling and housing markets rolling over tried a kay and james so my hock cake and purely to rin nick clearly as can be a you ascites but us value and i am just concerned that there is going to be a massive rewriting within the ress market yet even if the overestimate dozen stay flat ah within that you could see ten twenty fierce amstel deviation and therefore you could act them phenomena strong returns from value stocks traditional valley stocks and there are loads both passive and active to get as might be connective to get exposure there i would think would a would be a good position then hot potato an only go i am slightly dramatically i think with german equities and and that could have built slightly on on my anna was saying but i'm worried about a couple of things and worried that the m e germany is the backbone of europe and the anarchy tradition when we've had pannier in europe's the prefer that soul off the most and i think i'm breakin could ache weigh on germany are not practically bolsena sentiment certainly i think the readeth reason he would do that is there are a lot of headwinds racing germany moment am and the autos are just this great example mameena you cajoled as well that the impact of chine sloots is enormous idling will been all worked through in in the german market and the tariff risk is there and as annealing actually the market as has now adopted the narrative that the new regulations around pollution have driven or the procopio al issues that isn't as much more fundamental to worry by those well so so i'm pretty worried about m german equities affected by the periphery with the yuan on the proper and halo of urine a cabell and thank you all very much indeed at erato time i hope that

17.wav,this forecast is for investment professionals only welcome what can you know from sixteen thousand conversations well that's how many meetings for denis is one hundred and sixty five annalists have had in the past year with senior managements at companies across all sects and all regions the twenty nineteen analysts survey reflects that wealth of information to create a unique view of the global corporate landscape and how we think it'll fair this year with me to day to talk over some of the key findings are fidelis directive research for equity michael says and global head of research for fixed income marty droppin welcome tea both thank you or images to be he could well let's stop with a bit of background on what makes this survey unique as i described at mossy on kinky hoot here well it's the night there we've been running to survey richard and a is it a great way that we can pull information out of our of out of our equity and fixed in commonality who collaborate on a normal basis but ah we have an always spread across a asia a the uce particular and tissue in fact we've introduced away of a growing team in toronto as we are able to bring him we've been able to bring in the north american perspective as well and what does he add that other surveys in a macron mica data that they don't what's a true it's a true bottom up look at ja at the world if you will ah whereas lots of surveys to come out of vaaka the soul side while take will come from a macro prospective and very be very topped down that look at a data that's that's already out there our survey is based on analyst engagement with managements and you mention the number of meetings that we do this survey is really built up from the conversations that our annalists have with this management teems and it's very forward looking a caen michael let me come to you then to ask how they form these opinions or annalists while it based on the inside of the gain from talking to the major corporate ah the insight they gain from talking to their competitors to their supplies to the distributors private companies to industry context to expert is really a part of the sort of mosaic of insight that we garner from all of those different sources and which we hope to bring to bear on the investment process a cabalist gets to it the meat of this year's survey itself to me by the overawe picture the sentiment indicator where alais aroused to gauge management optimism for the year ahead and that's declined this year right across the board ending two years of steady improvements or what was it i well i think the first thing to say is yes sentiment has declined glibly be got to recognize this as some very strong starting point in twenty eighteen which in fact was the strongest send an indicator we recorded during the lifetime of the survey am so a long way to fall yes and we remain in positive territory globule in every region except china i think my sector almost every sect was down in terms of sentiment apart from health care no doubt reflecting the traditional defensive qualities of that sect but again or lay their down most sectors remain in positive territory the exceptions being utilities and consume a discretionary which i think within a touch on later in the pocus we will and m marty theses and aggregate a number covering credit as well as equity and what does the sentiment say am about the fixing came well and what your ownest you sir as a couple of things to think about that richard first of all fixed in camenis ten to a approach approach companies of it but differently their much more focused on cash flows so the questions are wide ranging and the same questions are asked to to every annalist whether their equity or fixed income but i think you having that balance of views brings out joliet more depth when it comes to the balance type questions i'm now i think the other the other angle of itza and if i can be a bit cynical about about how fixed and come in all sir cynical we tend to be a little bit more sceptical about the world and so i think i think you'll get out of that balance of an equity view and a fixed inconvenient to are to that water over our environment i can will let's take a look at one sector on its own now infects one which has suffered one of the biggest fools in sentiments at the consumer sector at harriet waldos is one of our aleuts actually she covers some of the big companies in the u s and tells us here what she thinks is going on over the last twelve months tears that key drivers of cost presentation of being labor costs and freight costs and there probably the two biggest cost items fir for retailers in general some companies have been more affected than others because of the way that the ship lightens around the u s so inflation precious therefrom labour and freight cost says herod if a she she goes on later in the interview to say that it's the cost of labor wages within freight that of the biggest burden rather than a fuel at michael ates sorts of precious on margins evident elsewhere they are i mean i think that and we are daphne at seeing a pick up in wage inflation ry pressures and around the world arm and normally you would hope that these can be passed under the consumer and margins would be protected that we are seeing some signs that a margin as starting from a very very high starting point an uneconomic numerian where consumers weakening is it's harder to pass on those costs to the final consumer that was one of the strongest responses coming through thee the surveyor and margins wasn't it yes it was and interesting me i think also the consumer discretionary side was one of those sectors which is suffering the biggest a reversal in sentiment and and i think you neither a number of factors at work there and that's the a cost precious as harriot described a week of consumer particular china arm and unreal the sort of head winds that the sect faces and tongues of the move from high street on line and really if anything accelerating and overseers more and more our goods are delivered that puts up a pressure on an unfrightened delivery cost and most unhappy a concern is that squeeze or morgans from it from a credit perspective warn't one of the things that showed up in the survey was that jah our annalists generically see balances deteriorating particularly in the u s ah that is a factor to to think about him would do every day as far as that goes a your balances are still relatively strong if you look at leverage a through through the cycles of the last ten years it has increased in its back towards where on back towards where we were near approaching ten years ago prepotent crisis however your interest rates are still well by historical standards and and jes finding cost our starting to rise which is another thing that came out of the survey but there starting to rise from very very well levels and so am yet it is less concern on the credit side as far as what this wage inflation will will do to over company balances so you took my funny costing low will that because we're in a low rate and virat the moment because as a very benign information picture but are these the first signs that am a inflation may well start to pick up when you start to see it in an ina increases adding there are some classic late psycho signals coming through the survey and ethereal clod at a lot about that one of the themes that harry picked up one about increasing cost within the consumer sector is a pervasive thing throughout the whole to survey although with wages rising presumably consume a sentiment a wind would rise which she owned of woodward balance set out to it to a degree he would hope it would balance it out to a degree but and that certainly not not the picture emerging from our consume ran lists as i said that may be in part because they've been somewhat beaten down by some of the other precious er than the sector thick rather one even one of the points of really be be concerned about is it wages arising you would want to look to see what the ability of of companies is to pass that along and ah you know that the survey also suggested that there is some pricing power a in different sectors but broadly speaking as a bit of a concern that a the companies may not be able to pass along the proselyter it back into these merchants exact you fixed alluded to at where we are in the economic cycle am of course the threat of recession it does seem to be big theme for twenty nineteen sent nea question many peoples a lips in the survey asked the annis directly each stage of the economic cycle their companies are in and michael has been quite a marked shift hasn't there there has a mean much more support for the idea that expansion is extreme mature and many more unless and last year calling out a slow down in fact roughly one third of the annalist in the survey reported amalon this ere verses just over ten per cent and in the prior year but still interestingly within the survey very little support for the idea that were in recession what why not i mean arcis if you read headlines for so much negative around than people seem to have talk themselves into it to a degree but the annalist are not saying that the not seeing it that this not reflected in their forecasts that's not that that's not the narrative that picking up from talking to companies no you might argue that companies are almost the last to know in some cases but that's that to just not the message we're getting i mean when i look at our numbers am the aggregate numbers from one of the financial models in the system is really consistent with the message that yes growth is slowing and but were not in recession now clearly there are some factors that we need to think more closely about in tons of fiscal stimulus are in terms of inner is the path of interest rates can be quite as aggressive as some other sort of people calling for a recession of talked about was certainly getting a more davis tone and from the fed so far and in twenty nineteen is definitely changed has it motivate michael raises the right point which is yes growth is sowing but we also came were coming off of a very very strong prod of growth in twenty eighteen so it still growth and and i think that was driving a lot of the annals responses is guess things are swelling down but it's not disastrous and i at this point when they got twelve months out they're still saying high single detouring grow saw an aggregate and so that that to me is is yet historical well as some take another moment with one of our anneslie sosia she covers financial for equities again he's been noticing other late cycle signals one of the phenomenon though we've seen in the back half of two thousand eighteen is a significant influx of alternative source of capital which has been an inhibit or two us bank longer of alternative sources of capital might be headphones private equity funds insurance companies or even long funds by mutual phone companies it tends to enter the market sort of later in a cycle eye intend to find that that is a typically a yield seeking or risk seat seeking types of funds so bad news for banks that count or won't compete on on price perhaps mossy tummy about these alternative sources of capital element on this is classicality call our signals where banks who who are under some significant regulatory scrutiny from the global financial crisis are still under this pressure and so gito accompanies me to raise funds and and there's demand and so that their looking at other sources of capital i think one of the places that we realise the credit markets as quiver clouds and dumb there's been phenomenal growth in leverage some of this is on the demand side people are sort of investors or positioning for arising rates and lever joins can be floating great instruments and so am there some natural hedging that's involved in that the risk is that never joins are supposed to be the safer part of the balance shape and unfortunately ah because it's late psycho companies of a lot opining power and those very few investor protections that we typically like to see in a more senior part of the capital lochiel's aunt sir particularly vergers there they're not vigorous and in some cases non existent entity when we picks up on that it is something to really watch out for a minute's interesting from an equity point of view probably equity investors and reassured that the banks are not chasing growth at the expense of margin because clearly and what we seeing sensible financial crises of the banks significantly repairing their balance sheets substantially improving their capital ratios and really putting themselves in a position where for the first time since the crisis they can start really thinking about returning excess capital to shareholders about boasting divide and growth and my senses that bank investors with much rather see that capital come back to them than chasing growth that may may not be there in attractive rate of returning on that capital but they finally in a position though and to tackle the last crisis omemee talking another discussion at whether thee'st for thee that for the next correctitude ver it might be a lesser better possession of another crisis comes because their balance sheets are in much better state than they were last time round it would in a with funding costs going up marty are their expectations at the fort rates widout would go up these well that that's it's picking up on quite a few themes here so what one of the dynamics in the market i as we have a fairly flat yod curve and so what companies have been able to do is if if they would have taken advantage of of glower interstate at this shorter term part of the capital structure they would have had more short term in answering i fought yorkers meant that they could push out these maurits so to think another one of the reasons that the analyst don't i don't see an eminent recession is that the funding wall was quite a few years out and so if if you look at her at the statistics it's not until twenty one twenty twenty one twenty twenty two we we really look at refining needs for companies so no pressure really until then no big pressure in the train well that sense or rather encouraging what temper were other positive things if you found in the survey michael i think that time from an equity in restless point of view and i think it's important to note that we are and perhaps less positive on divide and growth outlook but still positive so am dividend growth is in fact the strongest indicator of sentiment within the survey and when i dig down into our enlists models and forecasts yes we've got dived and growth slowing in twenty nineteen but was still looking for five per cent global that's a real rate of growth firsts inflation and and it is positive albeit less than the eight per cent we was seeing in twenty eighteen and i think a similar picture emerges on things like capital spending yes capes is weaker ah but certainly that has to be seen in the context of really a very strong survey for capital spending in twenty eighteen of an in fact first predicted in the twenty seventeenth what well let's talk about capes or because it is interesting i will get an analyst visit while he is an alloy covers tex stocks and he points out about how the effects of fiscal stimulus in the states of fading meaning slow of business in his sector sentiment and mighty spending has changed a fair bed from last year but i think that is sir or something which you should observe on relative domes rather unabsolved reality around this is that last year united states which is while the largest spenders and iterating a had a significant tax change which allowed lord companies to move from their tax savings into inditing projects and had led to his significant accretion in hiding spanner went up to eight nine per cent if you will and since that time for that as a comparison point are twenty a nineteen was all his expected does no doubt so surmounts giving us an example there some of the front loading that's been happening as result of president trumps at policy's last year and doeth explain the falling cape expectations we see in this year severity it certainly plays into it and and clearly peri you look at the you as there were two major thames going on last year he had some fiscal stimulus hitting the market and you had it the change in tax carriages or both of those were significant drivers of earnings growth in twenty eighteen i think one of the things that came out of the survey is an expectation that the trump policies won't be as a positive across the companies that that annals covered this year that shouldn't be that much of a surprise given that youth twenty eighteen was such a big year and the political situation is a little bit less certain this share given that to other democrats have taken over the house so yam not at all surprised to see that annalists are a little more cautious on the ability for the u s to manage some of some of the the fiscal policies issue and effect internationally michael the lot of the others turned quite negative and then the still just positive a on trump within the u s and but externally it is its ready concert yes i think there's been a real change in the narrative around trump i think when we look at the prior surveys as a lot of discussion about the regulation particular in the financial sector and the us talk about so the pump roaming through fiscal stimulus so clearly some the shyness come off that and at the same time the whole narrative around trade abenadar a very significant negative and particular as i think it was particularly prevalent in the news at the time of the survey and so that's clearly one of the factors we need to see how that plays out going in going through twenty nineteen will is here directly from asia case mc lean as an analyst based in hooghe covers a the asia riginal teck hardware and semi conductors are accompanied and he's telling us a abit more about that fallen sentiment in china the big change of observed in china of the last years of big increasing uncertainty both from consumers incorporates i think the major driver this has been the trade was within the corporate sector and there has been a big gar pushed to delay ordination of factories and capering expansions in the back their mind i have the risk that they may need to relocate their capacity to south e sesia to avoid the terrace so katydid telling us that companies are halted some investment in case any to move affect he also describes tynes companies considering moving home from the mainland and american companies which have already moved their operations to southey station yet known milesian and toland were that that's definitely hurt the outlook for china which his way we seen the biggest fallen sentiment isn't it it certainly had the outlook for china armed sentiment with particularly weak and china and so trade with what was part of the narrative but i also think just the economic performance particulier fourth quarter was really some of the weakest who seen in china for a long time so an auto sails were down over the course of the year in in china and protector the fourth court was done double digit and very similar picture emerging on smart for sails so were really seeing the first sort of negative numbers being printed in in china certainly in the duration of the survey and i think one of the intriguing things was that yes sentiment in china was negative but actually the closer you get to china in tons of unless on the ground the more negative it was and that sexual reversal of the prior survey were actually our annalists outside china were much more concerned and what about the picture in china because an there's been some stimulus from monetary policy home attempts to to de boost at the economy and there is fiscal stimulus as well but but what was the picture there a hag but growth aswing ah the government has recognized that there's too much debt in this system ah it's something we weep and paying attention to for quite some time and were starting to see some de foin china and done you may be surprised to hear this from a fixed income person but this is actually it's a positive a thing that were starting to see a good bit of what i would call managed to faults amidst pervasive if i return to reality i think you could call it dad's probably good way to describe a richard which is a ita it's it's ver companies that perhaps received funding that didn't have the most robust business plans some of those companies are now being allowed to fail if you will and ah here the ideas that were left with her a healthier economy of lethean and if it's managed well by by the government too queerly as is as quite involved in things then then i think it will leave us in a much healthier state and and that is our general view oh lest to try him up with a few summaries from from this year's alina survey and what's the main message that you're left with a michael at the interval thus i am very much left for the message of slow down rather than recession and a slow down that we have to see in the context of a very high starting point in twenty eighteen mossy ye ithin that that's clara it doesn't matter for equity are fixed income that that's the view we ask the annalist a number of questions on estan sustain ability and its clearly gaster the theme was a dramatic increase in the focus on companies that we cover on yes ah we didn't see that dramatic increase this year but we we we see a continual increase in things and an eve picking up on the china theme that showing some continued increase in the number of companies in china that are actually thinking about e s g it is something as a little bit surprising they came out of the survey it's it's that dumb ina in china even the number of companies that are focussed on esch continues to increase which isn't something you'd expect in in in people's preconceptions perhaps as row of attitudes towards i had eaten sustainable that's ray tender i'd like to think we have a little bit of something to do with that because zenanas are asking lots of questions are to manage me teams and we hoped that de planting a seed globule a fruit for them to start thinking about sustainable issues and and michael am give you an opportunity think of anything surprising that to that popped out of the surveys he first went through the data when we were me we got it back for the others i think two surprising things that i would highland one is perhaps hollo we are saying it to slow diamond and and there is a certain amount of gloom and doom that perhaps could it be worse would be my question i'm then the second thing is in a perhaps people are just becoming you know for one of a better free board with the whole political environment because i deftly feel that some of the some of geo political risks

18.wav,a hallo and welcome to a new series from fidelity international where we tap the brains of our annalists to learn about the industries and business as you are investing him i'm nilghai he added aridity when a very good morning walk up to singing the single poor zoo where every day thousands of visitors get up close and personal with orang outangs the world's largest arboreal mammals these majestic apes spend most of their lives in the tree tops of the jungles of sumatra and borneo it's where they eat sleep and raise their young but it might not be long before zeus are the only places left to see these creatures they are critically endangered because millions of hectors of their habitats have been illegally logged or cleared to make way for palm royal plantations and the palm oil producers are under increasing pressure from consumers and geos and investors to lessen their environmental impact from the jungles of south east asia we moved to the steel mills of northern china where the government is closing the least profitable and most polluting plants in part to reduce the thick toxic smog that can hang over the homes of hundreds of millions of people missus strong arm topped down industrial policy but it is staunched financial losses and improved air quality so what did these two stories of environment related pressure mean for the industries in question will short term pain brought on by external pressures meet a long term gain for the companies and investors involved and what might that mean for other sectors facing similar challenges i spoke the fidelities annalists on the ground in asia to find out joining me here to day in fidelities singapore offices in the heart of the marina bay financial district are forest salts an equity in this an analyst who focuses on medals and mining across asia and min linley a research associate who covers equites including palm oil producers among other things forest milan welcomed you both banks for is china's government has been taking a rather top down approach to cleaning up pollution at its steel mills what have they been doing so that the original reason they had to made this capacity was that you had a steel industry in a coal industry that had a trillion dollars of liabilities that weren't being effectively serviced so the government decided we need to do something to improve the profit ability these companies so that they can pay down a lot of the step that they had and then when they decided to do this they were quite clever actually in saying that they would do this in a way they would have the secondary benefit of really improving atmospheric pollution so they went after the steel mills that were the dirtiest set were the most dangerous inmate they just basely shut down this capacity seen were talking several hundred million tons of capacity that was either illegal or just unneeded really give us says of how big the steel industries in china at the amount of capacity they've taken out what is that in the bigger picture they eliminated probably a hundred and twenty million tons of illegal steel capacity there was in being recorded statistics anywhere and probably some around two hundred million tons of legal capacity sea you're talking about to north america is worth of steel consumption of capacity that were wiped off the face of the earth and as they've done as we've seen marked improvements and air quality in china particular in the northeast where the topography is particularly challenging and pollution tends to get trapped in the winter easily a move of pretty epic proportions in terms of the scale and scope of things in just as the same as you saw like the growth of the seal and did street in china was probably something we'd never seen you know in the history of the world we've never seen a decant ports big as this anywhere else in the world either milan a palm oil producers have also come under pressure from external parties so be safe to reduce their impact on the environment that pressure though has come from something quite different than what we seen in china with the situation though so alone of the treasures have been coming from consumers from due so for example in nieva nestle there have been coming on the pleasure increasingly because of the way they have been sousing pom o as well as consents on the wee home oil has been producing planted how y plantations actually result in deforestation because forests have to be clear in order for planting to take place and actually is one of the key producing crop for indonesia a pat from timber and pop for example and then also also leads to the loss of vile diversity because it's known that when tom oi plantations we place forest these results in the loss of flora and fauna in the lingering at things including along with dan as soon as the asian elephants as much on tigers as well i can have lost as a result of pomeroy plantations replacing forest and in the pressure coming visibly from buyers and yell me me from bias at the end of the supply chain for us the steel in the palm industries than very impacted on the environment in pretty different ways but one way they both have a very visible impact on the environment is in terms of air qualities specifically you've been in northern china on a bad air day or what on their later apocalypse can you paint the picture for us little bibi intend to go to the less tourist parts of china as you know a metal and mining list and usually going to steal mill towns and aluminium smelters and coal mining towns and in i can think when i was in young joe maybe half a year ago a year ago and was in one of their worst air quality days and this is one of the worst cities in china for are quality but as soon as we got off the train and left the station near everyone's eyes were burning and the back of your throat you have this canal greedy feel and it smells a bit of sulphur or rotten eggs and it's pretty pretty intense when when you keep mind this is a city like nine ten million people were were not talking about me wandering through the actual aluminum smelter this is just walking through the city by the train station on the flimsier you go to these cities nay it looks a lot like shanghais to look to me in no two thousand forty thousand fibre whatever and there has been this on the flops incredible improvement in the quality of people's lives actually round that same sharp where went to juno i was in a hotel and i think takshony nd there was a guide whom he had kind of a bit odd chinese and i thought the first maybe he was making fun of my chinese since my pronunciation is imperfect either by realized it skaal almost deaf he was wearing this very high teck you no hearing it i was thinking man when i came to china seventeen years ago a guy like this wouldn't have been engaged in the economy at all he wouldn't be able to be a productive person because no one would they will afford this when you're travelling through these place do you see the flopsy of this industrialization near this development has really been incredibly beneficial for these guides but on the flip side the environment you know it it has to be addressed and then with the dear pollution i know maybe that's not the main issue when it comes to pumped tion but it has been as specifically here in single poor ride yet i think the hollis on a pollution actually picked in two specific years in seeing a boy we'll think about it in twenty thirteen and twenty fifteen so first fire cannot broke out in indonesia and then resulted in appleton the letter burning down virgin forester or a carriage result of flesh and burn or as a result of dry weather can it she just even result in primary forests being bone as well so it's kind of hut the track but if we look at said the light mapping the only thing that we can cutoff attribute it to is the fact that there's been bunning happening if as a result lashin but i am the attribute of blame to them said slash and burn so that you can plant poem trees basely ye so if i were to measure how bad his condition was in singapore i think on a clear day we have pierre's eyes of about thirty to forty and pierre's eyes were actually more than three hundred during those two years donate ten fifty nithing around the months of october also and that when his confident really hazardous levels schools are usually close when parsees reached between two hundred to three hundred and in indonesia there were reports there pierre's eyes were beyond one thousand the issues come of estelle that when seaport government raised this to indonesia became a political canvass and so then there came the pleasure on indents governments to make sure that they they do something about the evolution i recall walking on the street and must arete all sold out everywhere and i had to use my hair as i filled up with regard to air pollution i know that that one cut of symptom of expanding poem will production but the bigger one as you said earlier is kind of the loss of iodine ity and deforestation what are the companies themselves doing about this or however they were spending to this increased pressure be it from consumers or intermediary buyers or even from old neighborly governments like lexington i think i ought to go back in history an demselves the regulations coming out in making sure pomponatius a cnosus enable run we actually go back to appoint in time in twenty or four when the round table for sustainable tomo was form from several stick holders are we have double the blue ef you need leva and enameled pomo association and several other sticklers coming together to come up with standards which the king will be suitable and applicable to the pomo industry in tomes of the environmental unsocial and how local comedies should be better managed to address the key challengers of relating to the pam's and as a result company stated applying these standards in their planting and it was only in twenty eleven when the indonesia government stated coming up with a moratorium to prevent new conversion to home plantations from primary force that arius and as a result of the pleasures coming up from the hay issues an taint aten in twenty fifteen the joke government which came in twenty fifteen came up with a new regulation to extend a moratorium so this has actually resulted that in companies stopping new plantings especially from year twenty ten on what so we now see a much reduced pace or even zeolite of new plantings at least from the company sat which can be more visibly regulated and then what is the effect of that in terms of loveral supply a growth across the ale i think if we were to go back in time the pick planting for pomp i actually came in between twenty or five and twenty or nine for indonesia we have about at least twenty to thirty per cent grove in new plantings every year and since the mortalium came out in twenty eleven we are now seeing negative of zo new plantings they are coming out from companies what we are seeing why now is more of replanting because pomo has a twenty five years cycle so for those they have ich maturity they will then have to weep plants so new plantings are very limited from twenty ten on woods and as a result of this if we think about the impact on pommy supply was that seeing the whole supply of pomo going down more dramatically from twenty nineteen on letter structural under supply musically that we could abe if i were to compel against the man of let see forty five per cent per year for obedient as about sixty million tons of upon my consumption but you footnote moving elegantly to china and this steel production similar situation you you've seen a lot of supply coming off lying how does that effect near the men term i look for profitably of the sector yet act should draw a distinction that it's not supply going off line it's capac going off line i reck so if you look at steel production in two thousand eighteen it was actually very strongly up yer on yer but because their competing against less capacity thers for your people able to produce the profitably has improved sharply if you think of like a normal through psycho steel spread by spreading in the price of steel minus the three main material and puts no iron ore coking coal and scrap the normal spread would be somewhere new between two hundred dollars two hundred twenty two hundred thirty dollars somewhere there and during two thousand seventeen eight seventeen to love eighteen the spread was closer to three hundred dollars you know the high hundred or so now that's not just a fifty per cent improvement in profitably cause ye've fixed cost depending on the company you could have seen a much bigger increasing profitably in that we as also seen a big improvement and how lever these companies are as they've been able to pay down a lot of their debt are their softer costs to complying with this sewing fermo from a company standpoint here they challenged with you spending more dusty more to meet the pater environmental omissions conditions or regulations yet i think this is about as close as you get to everyone contagious winning write that the external costs our yet steals can be slightly more expensive a ton but that's really passed on to the eventual consumers of steel so you have you look at constructions but building maybe no single digit percentage of it is steel costan and that went up by a few percentage talking if you percent on if you presented so you don't really see that cost in pack anywhere on a social level but the benefit is huge and that you really reduced the financial sectaries like before these still knows all going bankrupt could have really bankrupt the chinese banking system and before you know when we had all the sturdy capacity which it was clearly negatively imparting people's health so i think this has been really you know an economic decision with incredibly positive environmental externalities and there's a gets another component to a talk about this systemic risk of under performing companies there's also attentat an unemployment problem that could be created there yeates another really interesting point of but if you think about the chinese labor force this is no longer growing this has been shrinking every year for the last couple years so the need to really create jobs in china is much lower than it would have been even five years ago just based on the democratic shape of you what every one called the age a profile of china we no longer really needs to create as many jobs you know yes there is a need to create higher quality jobs as you see urbanities you want to give jobs to people moved from the country said but the level of pressure that the government is under is much lower than it was before the other carnegie was thinking of is your china was ruffling feathers among keep trading partners with vast amounts of steel exports the laniers and now if you're reducing capacity taking capacity of wine or the then disinclined to export in to your trade relationships skip a little bit better yea your intuitions correct you sen a drop in exports in fact of steel from chinese you both because they've had a reduction in the amount of capacity have it also because there is strong demand for the steel so in two thousand eighteen there was a drop in exports and beyond that a kind of doesn't really matter if you're exporting it in your importing steel because this spread that everyone's enjoying is as kind of common to every one across the planet so china's consuming about half the steel on the planet chinas producing about half to steal on the planet if chinese profitably improves american profitably improves to some degree japanese profitably improves to some degree so this improvement and utilization that china has enjoyed has also been enjoyed by everyone else around the world as well milan with polo producers in the profitably situation is it a comparable situation where this coming kind of shortage of capacity will increase the profitably it would impact on powell prices that's yet to be proven my tea ciss that it was that coming in twenty nineteen to twenty when we start seeing the supply shot each coming through as a result of new plant things going down to zero or even negative levels from twenty ten on was by right now what we are seeing is a situation of over supply in the edible or his market and one of the key drivers or home prices is actually dead of sobbing eye for example because that's a key substitute for pom oi saw that's one of the key elements that will kindo affect the dynamics of how pommy prices should treat apart from the whole supply shot each issue as well of forwood sing in jena if you look at the winter of thousand seventeen to the start of two thousand eighteen beyond the capacity reduction program also have a production restriction programs cavasse reaction programs are really just about getting rid of excess passage improve the profit ability the winter restrictions there really folks just on environ mentally troubled areas and insane produced last steel during this time or admit last pollution during this time as they've kind of shifted to but in the winter of twenty seventeen slash eighteen we saw a twenty five per cent year on your improvement of kirkcaple as measured by the chinese ministry of environment ecology their target was fifteen per cent so that he overshot this part of this was due to you know whether an atmospheric conditions being particularly favorable but either way that the government really made it a marked improvement a year on urine and what they were looking to do so you know the environmental groups we talk to they were incredibly happy like they were impressed with the progress having had succeeded everyone's expectations where does that leave us was next in china are we gonna continue to see these twenty five per cent reductions your owner and lutes and emissions or is that a temporary blip i think that the twenty five per cent reduction we probably won't be able to match that rate of the climb think the decline and pollution will continue there's been a change of strategy whereas before the central government gave down top down orders too you know eliminate axeman of capacity in this region or to restrict production exmouth in that region now their saying look were more concerned with the outcome were less concerned with how you achieve that so if you are invest in scrubbers if you want investing some other technology to derections ena more power to you and organ allow the local governments figure out how to reach their targets rather than telling them recur emissions targets via capacity reactions or production reductions and then i think once we get a little bit further along i think the next battles really are can i be for water and then the final battles is for ground or soil pollution and water is not as much of an issue for metal in mining it it is an issue but for aluminium red mud creation which is a by product of making illumine is a huge issue and so i expect this'll be a big topic that will be talking about in future years men lingard think things go from here a mediator forecast hold up will see a fall off incapacity a short fall basely wouldn't that then encourage another flurry of people running out and and converting forest land into a pool production again though the more times on a tooth to five year pieces but have been consistently minute because of external pleasures coming through from and ament al watch groups are the governments to make sure that of the pollution standards are cantine in indonesia and militia saw in tomes of the flurry of new plantings coming through i think that that one happened disciple i guess the next battle for the pomona streets more of ensuring that small holders comply while we are seeing in the past few years has been the pleasure on distant companies or larger companies to make sure that they comply with the sustainable distended but it has been hot to ensure that small holders leave up to the same level ascendants and i think we need to address that because they format forty per cent of total production in order for keeper to really change the impression that we have on tom roy as a hall ye clearly some big challenges there i'm afraid we're out of time for to day but it's been a fascinating look at how two giant industries have been engaging with significant external pressures over their environmental impact and what their responses mean for both their long terms of stanby ity and profit ability i'd like to think my two

19.wav,a hallo and welcome back to rich pickings for deity's acid allocation pocus i am richard akim editor in chief soaking up some much needed spring some here in the city of london and talking of rays of sunshine could it be that the economy is turning a corner our research suggests it might also in this episode what tit for tat spats in the china west trade war mean for markets and we take the temperature of the sickly health care set them defensive or defective stocks listened on to find out law with me in the studio to help decipher the thinking behind this month's asian or anna suits head of global mericans and investment strait peter coroner put ferdy manager with the figures on gabled credit and james bateman chief investment officer for multi set welcome to you all as always i got a revelatory question to get a started your revelations i hastened to add and it's three hundred years since the publication of robinson crusoe i'd like to know what one is in would you take with you if you were marooned on a desert island anna that start with you i decided to go for a sane motion with their very high protection assuming i will end up somewhere on the very sane island let's hope it is a funny desert i live upset er would mate you well i'm going to go more tack and i'll say a solar powered waterfall traction system ah i don't know how long i'll be there and that i know i need water to stay alive maybe to start to her making some gin perhaps as were out one i am directly aunt jane's sir richie two answers neither of rich artifact cal the flipper on was a very large container of tartar sauce because clearly anything to endear allen's fish and then the less flippant but to stay before him was a piano because if i was stuck on her it does own for many many years i might by the end of it mastered playing well and if not it makes good foreword wish it heat and we'd like to hear you next time perhaps playing as you are at the moment but while laughton reduce the listeners to something to look forward to and at what were really here to talk about is the house view and can you tell us what the allocation is now as agreed by the team around the table where a man neutral on iquitos and both in the chateau nimium term an unnecessarily a reflection of of the same thing that you have been talking about her a few months now and another believe there is sir a disconnected between a economic fundamental sam and the market so the v shaped recovered that to have seen in equity market and since the shut of the year and as has gone ahead of fundamentals away still think that sir being more cautious on iquitos and risk makes sense that concerns there what about the other secretes a we are now on the way to a government bond sir again botham a temperate certain short term and meet him term and still a with credit in the new temoins three to six months but neutral over er a year twelve to eight in mothers a case it overish it away from from resume shift away but obviously adding a the derisive underweigh meaning that were not concerned about recession and that is something that is perhaps reflected to some extent and in the canalboat a cable peter with your interest and in order this tell us what what your view is on adulation there and how has this developed since the fid changed its tone it is really a question of risk reward in the course of the first quarter of this year we've seen government on markets around the world overshoot expectations of changes in policy over the course of the next six to twelve months and real rates in particular now have become a much more fairly valued in the u s whereas six months or so ago you could invest in the treasury markets and pick up a real yield of nearly a hundred basis points that's now been slashed in in more than half and looking at our own forecasts of intermediate term inflation a evolution in the u s we think that that the amount of competition that you get in government onset at the moment it is simply not enough for the risks that you're taking it not to mention increasing ever increasing supply it seems in the u s and how are you reacting with your own reporter well as anna noted word still looking at a situation whereby were not expecting of the onset of a recession in the immediate near terms so we would expect in that vionnet a excess return from spread product ant and that's how her position and really that under waiting government bonds that represents e an opportunity to capture that excess return for us with infixed comport folios i kate james bateman how does that match your thinking and the multi not dissimilar and and i think what's it was interesting to us is we spent the first half of the year revista puzzling about what would derail ecarte momentum and a mixture of fed behaviour and and more recently tariff seems to be effectively doing that and as anna says that bringing it back to towards fundamentals but at the same time a dozen doesn't make alderson to us too to be hedging arete positions in terms of recession risks because delighted recessions that she receded are rather increased so are you waiting for something big to happen before you change your your yukon it of the holding passion the answers yes but it was with the caviar that that clearly this is a aviaries for shorter term sitio ing so so we are clearly playing short term of market behaviours and i'm not quite sure where in her to sell the river by the fact scenario but but were certainly approaching that ware the risks of tip for that trade was its atra throws up very short tempo utility that you can take advantage of vickers the market will either under act beforehand over act after an event arm and fractures unjust before week we came in ere we heard that a china had to decide was going to levy santerre on about sixty billion dollars were out of a few escorts this is all par for the course now that we owe a weasand ready for that sort of news he would be even of the olive train rally at the interesting of course is they've delayed implementation until the beginning of june's was not effective immediately i presume that's partly trying to give that the u s a bit of le way to come to a compromise a doubt that will happen in time but in the set of game game of am aconite braman ship one there are no windows from any correct prospect of its cheek and a hurt arm in times of posies coming through i think turkey cushion to us his actually watching u s behaviour in terms of do we see the costing creases which now quite substantial passing through to end consumers and if we do do we see a of a political fall out that means that trunk can't pursue this policy for that long that's what the chinese will be watching as well essential the question of contracts from half to fold at some point or will you keep this it of bluff going so it's the er is waiting for the diplomatic game to start playing out in the economic date of hassan as it happens if fidelity of course we got several propriety tools to help us i sought out that sort of thing one of them is the fidelity leading indicated a fly degrees a range of daae to form a picture of the state of the global economy and where its heading where early causes up with their markets research ernest in samson for reading of this month's fly after it returned a much more optimistic or do i mean much less pessimistic reading than it has for a while more were in welcome to you i am hetta about the fidelity leading indicated the fly now that's moved into a positive reading for the first time since february two thousand seventeen is it time to crack open the champagne well you say positive richard it is positive acceleration for the first time since since way back then but it still points to growth or below trends a inhale the top left quadrant so yes but of acceleration but still relatively subdued and certainly below trained growth levels to the question really is the heart is to fly progress from here so we're goin a polecat bottom in growth sometime in cue three given the the fly tents have but three months flag but that's not really enough to get excited about so looking at there the undying indicating was as well to do ask where is the this sudden positivity coming from because we've been in the doldrums down in the grove negative and worsening him in he wants to wake up to that every morning so he is now finally turned a corner where is that improvement coming from so looking at the the individual sectors the improvements reasonably broad based so business surveys grinding that bit higher industrial orders as she starts into till i reflect that too for the consumer and labor indicators of a pert and most notably global trade which had had a horrible end as to last year and has has reached quite a decisive bosom but i think was perhaps most interesting is looking at some of the individual indicators that are really turned these are the ones that that really looked quite catastrophic going into the source of this year am and they've bounced and from from really negative levels and hence the ended this mighty spear the formalist after ye are almost bluely and weak patch that's me suggest that there might not be that much more improvement in the next couple of months that is not a dead cat bounce is not that missing a blip on it gentaro fall back to her where it was always say sir a bit more than a dead cat bones things aren't as bad as you might have thought at the start of the year and at the same time it might not be a there might be a maimed cast baroness or stumbles on a cat on three legs yes o k say he talks about the three months lag what should we expect then for the rest of this year based on what you're seeing in thee in the fly the three months life suggests given that were only just getting into positive celebration now is that we see something of a bottom and activity early in the third quarter of this year i am and then thinking a bit beyond her as i say it might be a couple of months of stumbling around as we try and make that that decisive a floor beyond that i think towards the end of the year some of the the policy measures we have seen coming in the fads the spent reserved turning more davis and some mercians sarnia that yes china certainly am doing a very large fiscal singers and credit similars and huon that will take time to feed through and it seems like the end of the year swung on my old coalescence and their cover starts to gain a bit more attraction so champagne on ice for our three legged cat that's exactly etagere oh anna every ham old summary perhaps a form of the father on the surface it does seem to be a significant moment would you agree with them with the ends reading oh this is certainly the first time in many months that we get this reading am so it is significant but i think it must be seen when it goes from here it cast them back her into the decorating quadrant would do know that to kanana was distorted in the u s in china and vilely by a number of factors and on the inventory accumulation psycho was one of them and so some of their distortion is now washing out in the sense that can bise the data to the upside under the down side i think there are tens designs of civilization but it's too early to call to call that the green shoots definite cringed shoes soon to say whether we avoided a recession of her exactly and i think he ingrowing see a sam stabilization of hovering on these levels a whole likely see that of the next few months and on second half of the of the sea is going to be a bit clear into the direction in my base case is that in we will avoid for the slow down and intercession but the expansion ahead as likely to be relatively subdued coquet and and peter do you take succour from from this from the fly improving well that to a degree but as animations again that the jury is out as to whether or not were just in transition from a growth as into a proper credit into false cycle or whether that's been forestalled and we were really will see a man a last and perhaps final phase of the expansion that were in at the moment we we certainly do take a little bit of additional of constructive signal from the flying that it probably means that the default cycle together with the amount of ample liquidity provision that's been provided by sintoba s i is not going to in a descend upon us in the next quarter or so but visibility beyond that into the end of the second half of this year and into the beginning of twenty twenty remains very limited as positive as i would expect of fixing to be may be better the glass is always half empty indeed yours is an anker and james was very tit was but ye i don't think either a desperately differing opinion i think either that we've had false positives in the reading on the floor before where we see material upswing and then it we see a further deterioration and that is an entirely plausible haps even likely outcome so as we set about markets as with economies and where towards the end of the cycle then he questioned how close we are to the end and of course will any ever know i am after the event i guess you the three six months view is somewhere between comfortable and anina may be positive but beyond then enoshima i get let me come back to you peace of them because and the high yield market is often called the canary and the coal mine and you're the cold face are you seeing any worrying signaler only just a few at the moment but none of them seemed to have really developed into a proper contagion mechanism to infect the rest of the the capital market so it has certainly we seen the risk adjusted under performance of triple sea credits which are the most highly levered balance sheets that did we can own in in high yield our investors are unwilling to dip down into that low quality sectors it tends to be very highly levered to to growth and wore a the an opportunity refiner of either one of those two o pillars of the performance is eroded from here we would expect triple seas to to get hit first and investors reluctance to basically buy everything in a dash for trash kind of style in a suvorin twenty nineteen is a little bit of a warning sign the other one in emerge markets clearly we have some on going rolling crisis in both a argentina and turkey but it seems to have been contained within those two jurisdictions for now could spill over it at some point but really requires additional external catalyst to do so so sands more like a watching brief a fern at will another area of the market which i certainly knows when fear is green because it seemed by vistas as a defensive sector is healthier but it's been in the headlines of late not for being a haven a safe even but because of its terrible performance here today the sector is done eleven per cent compared to a legal indices or earlier to day i caught up with some of fidelities health cartier coffee to find out what's been bringing the sect down and how some rigorous researches helped them dodge the fall alex in yore porterage with focus on an on health care and am i in a pretty a difficult year to date on what was going on yes so there has been quite tricky to the health cases down about eleven cent year dates to the end of april and this real excelling he last month a thing the main drives behind that had been some of the political noise in rhetoric coming out of the u s in particular as reproach you know i guess a year and a half way their twenty twenty elections in november the vases getting increasingly concerned about the tents reform though from a health casper generally evildoer prices and insurances of so lot of political pressure coming to there and it really is a sect that ripe before this sort of change in the states isn't it yes i thing this is to six hours about seventeen to eighteen cents of gepper on health care so it's always a very top cool you know have you had that compare two other countries there are the countries it sam was loten the majority countries in the rest of western europe of example so these companies are looking rather scared nor i think what point this interesting as that the farmer and the managed care which is the helpers in particular has increased rises and by the government invention on pricing or disinterment on the assurance side of things and to those companies more to those or some of the others in a meenit or like saeters company sir have less some exposure i care i got some priests and sam here out who the annalists who were looking on at this sector and spotted these concerns priest i'd let me come to you first of all had he come to make that call they are some enough covered the managed caesar among other stocks for three years and no involved loving through the the twenty sixteen election where an these managed karslake were wore big winners from the republican when and there the stocks performed very strongly out of that the whole period since then that the issues been we know that it could be risky into the next election it's anita more of timing so when when do you start to question these companies that have very strong fundamentals in a status collars the fact that the states corps could go away and naturally there's no there's no business for them and it has catastrophic as acting terms of their business wordily do other things but basically ate they manage the insurance coverage of fair of the populations through the commercial and shown somewheres out sartine the government's side if the government does it all like a like the any chest then there's no role for for these businesses and then the debate for alex and others investing and this says how far in that spectrum do you go because there is another a scenario meracle they can do more to health fayette set life in death and somewhat your view on this on this particular aspect so without the benefit of her covering they stopped on the last election it was a port for me to understand how they tried it in previous elections so mina's really focused on how managed catre in the last five elections that are revealed to me firstly the risk is certainly there round healthier policy reform is what striven draw down on the past and the hilary tetes a great example of where sentiment can a road and the secular at henry clinton hilary clinton and anna and entreats what happened so twenty fifteenth september day a hilary clinton came out with an incendiary twit essentially on no on on hydra pricing and even thy manage kate was not directly of relighted if casals effect at riting down twenty cents for the end of the year so we see that kind of sentiments are affecting managed care in the past we also don't really see the reward that you would expect a rebound going into the election because the sentiment had by the hand camp persist right through the election and if you do look in history can also see the health care form to perform as tends to be of the story of inferential ism rather than a complete transformation so for that reason i came out slightly less extremely bursted on ultimately medical materializing but still very courtenay on a political rhetoric affecting these sentiments and multiples of the mendicant observing an incendiary or inspiring the penny on where they were a farmer company one of the correct and alex had had this unparted and in your poor fellow as you are hearing this advice from me for the less yet so the managed careers about ten cents of the end of their glogova in debts which are investin so highly material and although i only had a small overweight and in that subsection early thoughts and caution was very important because it focus my mind and on the issue as early as february march rather than in a waiting perhaps until later on this year and that led me to adjust my positions downwards than actually i'd have no no exposure at the moment i'm unequal wake that subject in tamanac yes i'm equal weight subserving direct expansion so wears that money gol instead where the horses so for me in a helge's adova sexto and is about much more than a farmer and health mesuriers and bite we have lots of them good medical theology companies which makes love equipments in her hips and knees hearing ease for example and those who companies which is what forty cents the fondest vested in and have in my opinion stronger fundamentals and much less price of risk because i are any sixth cent of total government spent compared her farmers in twelve cents and in a manager in the much greater proportion from them i came well alex raconteur very much indeed where anna could hear there were to begin french politics can be on the performance of assets that becoming more of a theme for markets generally i say it has been already for a few years better my chair since before they ten sixteen elections and of course sir since the little brackets and a friend of a it has been in it if a litter i did as a apologia it has been elizabeth quiet in particular with a breathed in tuebingen pushed an hour to it was the end of this sir ah but of course it hasn't gone away so we'll have for breast coming up over the european elections in a couple of weeks here and then we'll be watching what what happened afterwards were with the open commission leadership et cetera and an en have the use elections coming up and certainly tramper is already campaigning wood would thee with a trade war and attentions as collating am ended something that will matter for the markets of course the sort of noise and politic so as always it is very important to distinguish her signal and what actually are matters for fundamentals just from noise that moves market of her headlines but peace from the fixed incumbency what is keeping you awake at night and on the political front well i aside from the original and a seasonal issues that death that on his mentor really is down to that a relationship between thee and the two global super powers in whether or not we are just in oboe late rounds the late hands of a of a poker match or whether there is something a little bit more structural going on there in terms of the schism between china and the u s and the outcomes for the leaders of both those systems at the moment may actually be better in terms of their own ability to play to their base and reinforce their own power by continuing to escalade as opposed to reaching in agreement quite to quite quickly and in a clearly marked disappointment around that over the course of the last week is manifesting itself a yet market still want to believe that over the course of the next forty eight weeks it'll all be o k and we'll have a resolution and were not in the midst of a massive gopal inflection and i think that that's just a little bit sad too under priced at the moment and just to confirm that your glass is now empty i not even half empty ah but when i coming to the end of this portas which means its time to play hot cakes and hot potatoes what which you buy like a hot cake what would you drop like a hot potato let me start with you again anna am in in the currency world alike a swithun or good safe haven perhaps against the basket of both the doll and the hero a play ye there weakness potentially and but this is a disagree the edition which i preferred last time and by the way it has done quite well aerie should follow absently at the enderley what about your hopital devout marked duration which we have disgusted anything the yields er i really so low now than at supported by fundamental succes hops cake and pocket richard is anything that's it's alternative enough said that before be anything that doesn't have a traditional market exposure turning as cash platon and you know that could be could be and tis the most exotic you would go for timber slits timber and in not exotic but were going home artificially am in a windfall or or so releasing from any here to be at the moment or just in a carreta on short strategy but something without direction because i don't think now's the time to have a directional position on in any real asset class a moughty drop i think i'd dropped that i was at i was pondering this one or lot m u isocrates in particularly growth of the venti you want to call it but berber in attack particularly but but u s in general and i think that is that the marquis is are much petaled too probably pricing in a six to ate eat resolution to the trade war with china and even six to eight months is perhaps more likely may be longer but therefore i think the idea that that the west won't at least get to rolled partly from that is is is perhaps naive and actually there is a story in which it causes an inert of glowering irritation away from the earth that could be quite significant sir that's my appetite i can tom peter final foot with you your hot cake what you buy yer hot cake would be a generically anything that represents the kind of risk that we can buy in fixed in come markets it looks an awful lot like what james has just advertises his hot cakes so looking for stuff with strong acid cover strong security package which seem quite a lot of very interesting new issues in the high old markets a year debates that his transition out of the lone market has thus been looking to i express itself in a different way from companies that are distressed within the high yield markets but in exchange for that they need to offer up some additional securities a better act cover something that we can sleep more comfortably at night with holding through the next down turn cycle as we expect that a recoveries would be impaired in those security so for the moment that's my sort of generic hot cake and your potato take their hot potato i think i agree again with what james said on the text side but that's not necessarily reflected and in valuations values a pretty balanced in in technology credits but in tellico credits of particularly in us invest grade telephone that sector is trading pretty much at the time it's difficult to see how much additional spread compression you might get there put another way the margin for safety in in those acid valuations is very limited at the moment as so i think that antico sided a source of funds to buy something a little bit more secure jolly good well that's it and i hope that's giving you an

20.wav,this port cass is that investment profession was only another and an earth this is an investors guide to china a new pot carts from fidelity international and millie parisian and federated management and acetic and i'll be taking you deep into china economy what makes the country tick the air is that are most exciting and the ones to avoid both footnote gentleman and the determinedly is built of decades of experience in china in her chemise or bring new fidelities portfolio managers vesicles and other specialists who cover the market and can share with you their expectation on the moon moon bathed the monster has been his story to chinese capital markets company share and bonds have stepped into the international spotlight included on globe in the seas for the first time but how open is china really to investors exactly how far down the road of liberalizing as china stan to day and watched him best as watchful next to help me answer these questions i joined by three of fidelities china experts with me in shanghai is linda joe a portfolio manager whose base in the city linda your baste here but how long have you known shanghai he am a mexican her niece i was born and brought up here but i went to hong kong for study and in further outlook in the last year its physical the open up of the china market bring me back so i relocate the whole family back to shanghai after almost twenty years adjoining us from hong kong we have brine collins a portfolio manager and head of our asia fixed income seem so bride how much does china figure in your asia portfolios oh john is a significant part of our portfolios directly and indirectly but you could easily account for half of the exposures that we have and and growing frankly and and of course indirectly china has a significant influence on on asia lest the rest of the world and also in hong kong we have george esther so polis a portfolio manager in the malaita sir george how close are you to the chinese market that in recent years we have found ourselves increasingly participating in china across the cups the cob structure whether it is china bones of siege bees so the safe part of the cub structure increasing me the past year or so in china high yield and more recently in chinese equities as well so particularly puttin for us in recent news thanks george and thank you all for joining me to day at linda for those he's been in china for a decade and a half and you know you can see that the shanghai skyline has changed beyond all recognition in that time but what about the country's financial markets where are we in that journey no that's actually of their interesting questions for now because we will know that china by far is due a relatively more close up market a yew have to kapiolani dupe pretty much closed on the financial margraves is system in a pasture of three years the opened up happening what is really encouraging his inner past of one year we do see that speed of open nap or actually accelerate to quilt probably that's because sir is one of the negotiating conditions or hoop the trade wore though we do were happy to see that process and brought in george but are both very frequent visitors to china but from your vantage point in hong kong what's you'll take on the pace of change brian i would say it a little mixed up in its very rapid manum i very much look at the domestic capital markets in china and see them as not developed but rapidly developing so in some respects the rate of growth in the size of the market for one has been impressive immense when we have never seen this before in terms of the growth of a dead capital market or capital mark more generally the good thing for china is that it's got large established develop markets around the rest of the world which it can effectively a mirror or at least reflect or take the best of if you will we've seen some good improvements with the regular tree oversight especially around the banking system and around a regulating shadow a banking for example and shadow financing channels over the last couple of years in particular yet on the other hand there are some aspects little things which still have a long way to go at one of the obvious ones that are what we feel is significant for the onshore domestic bond markets is simply allowing greater use of really basic derivatives like bond futures government bond futures for example which are available then they used but for example his international participants were not yet able to use that as are some other participants now we feel that that will change and will obviously continue to develop in this always this balance between making sure that the development of any capital market is a measured its controlled not excessive or creating any kanopic risks but on the other hand given the size effected the bon markets thirty odd truly newest dollars in size where we expect within the next five to six years that number to be easily thirty truly newest dollars in size that's as big as the estate capital markets so if you think about in size terms began acquit each other very soon but when you think about the depth and breadth and the sophistication of the two markets chinas well well well behind said scott lots of room and opportunity to continue to grow and we've seen that same sort of development also in the same terms of the ashamed as well when we think about that of index inclusion at george when it why look at the the chinese market despite the sort of the development of it the depth of it liquidity of the market the volatility of the market still gives me the impression that it still a very immature or developing market but what your perspective on that it is a more retail driven market so rita investors anson china the responsible for roughly about eighty per cent of trading for activity of turn over when they hauled about twenty per cent of the outstanding these numbers are slowly changing with the inclusion that we saw we are seeing a little bit of those dynamic changes still very early days i think about ten per cent now or firm or of the outstanding services is held by by foreign vessels so this will gradually change dynamics and will have a positive important volatility but having said that i had also like sir to mention in inclusion typically what happens when a country gets included in in an index you tend to have the by by the rumors sell the fact that's what happened with you a caparison going back with a tion and courier should offer many many years ago and this them around with china it's being the exact opposite we were we knew there was good a inclusion and sometimes of earlier she would impatiently know thee the extent of it but last year despite decent earnings growth in china we saw a huge huge compression of multiples so we didn't really see some of this pine buying the room asserting the fact that then created a very interesting buying opportunity on the back of very attractive valuations after the a valsin compression of last year and the marquis is steadily becoming more interesting and last year and it was because you know we could a multiple surprises armed from both inside and outside i think outside one armed the trade waren is provis till going on by the inside wise year vanish marche de lave is almost to come to the end so it does look more interesting from now unless they would trade walls for a bit of a sea where it were in this environment now terrace being imposed by the u s on china in the retaliation and the were seeing george how serious is this and how much of an impact is it having on your acid allocation views as is your sort of thinking through the portfolios as a short term a situation or something that you see kind of extending for four quarters ahead of us or trade was a and he keying that we monitored was what is the impact on the chinese economy and from our respecting we have done a lot of work to and understand from the bottom up what does it really mean a napiers and to day verses ten fifteen years ago the impacted days were very different because to day the chinese coney has managed a transition from an expedient one that a big part of you depicts driven by the consumption story so trade war fifteen years ago would have had a much bigger impact than what it has an to day i'd like to come in on currency though because i think either one of the things i found but of a unbinding particularly surprising was how weak the currency was as we went through two thousand eighteen but despite all of these headlines around trade as when yet she looked at the currency yuste little but of weakness but really it's been in a more resilient may be than one might have expected as we look through at two thousand nineteen a briny using value in the currency or do feel that there's kind offer the weakness to come here the arab is er it's in a bulgar ency it's a for all intents and purposes it's a managed trade waited currency and specially you can start to see how domestic monetary policy in china is playing a bigger roll in the direction of the currency so you mentioned that it was week during two thousand and eighteen which was the reverse of two thousand and seventeen verses the estella because monetary policy grows trajectories are actually diverging select currency should do in two thousand and eighteen the pabo sea was easing monetary policy the was fed was actually starting to hike grows trajectories between the two actually starting to diverge the us of stronger china was starting to moderate so you should see a currency behave that way like a natural stabilizer that's what they do that's one of the great things about having a currency but i want to bring out this business point on value though i want to bring out a point on volume linda when you look at the currency you see value said tough crushing his head is an as an insider in a people always trying to do diversification because we see the cretans ion speed an it's so much faster the nominal dyke grows that's way internal wise i think no master people always have a a feeling and a fear of the currency depicting that's ready they willing to put the money in two things like her you know and properties or even haycart does not you cash sit in the context george of your portfolio you can you can be hedging out currency are you hedging the currency at the moment and we have been hedging the currency for the past month sorcery two weeks before some of the trade wichitas came back the surface and the reason for that is we sort of thought that the kindly had gone a long way so far this year he was prizing in a lot of good news the hedge in causes a result had come down quite significant last year hedging cars were about three and a half to four per cent almost the entire coupon you'd be getting from the bonds on the other hand of a month ago so they had got down to bases points of maren price in very good news and had in corsage low without there was a good opportunity to reduce some of our remember exposure here the ancient rate differential have completely converged between the arab and the u s i'm a between china and the uses me so those hedge in cost are negligible now i wouldn't say this value in the currency only because there are downside risks there are psychological eer barriers if you will ticul for the domestic consumer and domestic confidence that seven is it is an issue but frankly it should be able to break through that if china needs to be able to adjust to a relatively high level of detect p if it needs to a use that as a too within the trade war negotiations may be but currencies need go up and down to be a natural stabilizer and the problem is with a close capital account with with a managed currency its ability to do that has both very strong prose and cons just turning to the economy will brought him in one of the things international investors really struggle word linder's autonomy reed on the chinese economy and me from inside the country i what's your view on where we are in the business like how do you get read on the on the economy thought very easy even for the hatorask and person because the volatility in the genii number its verona and tis extended reflect in a hole economy changes so we do have some embitter indicator sings like power generation things like a discretion of spending on some of the key items i think it's more can of close the reality type of primates and also i have for some personal tennessee i bettina i atoka anseis car and system twice a day abstinent taxes twice a day yea helca that's actually quite der and good valley for that as we too got a lot of intimate dying subsidise on that shed cart and service so i'm i took the driver's toi said date interesting thing as these taxi drivers they are not full time taxi drivers are most of time they have another job and quote their axes in the owners are you know so at death that our time they can discern some additional measure me small small companies momin and enterprise they can give you the really first hand kind of information of what's happening on the grand like quick temple one of the driver i may remember last year and he raised pigs and in a haha yes oh so you know he told me it's very top flat to ear you know in its business and he was thinking that he'd made coast down its business and in unhitch to another one so that's to be clear in a signal of twelve of the cycle of of the pig market and how did you act on that i what did you do on the back of that information usually thou wilt give you some idea of in a wean of turning point in an also illative you just give you an idea so after that i knew to prove that i talked to her at the really big kepi raising companies to see if that's really in a cold city the don cycle of the market i think that probably gives me some of the information earlier you no quicker before i really picked up some news from from you know am blumberg or uniform an ourselves i report that threatened for his hand information you are one to things that i am really interest in a moment is really the roll that kind of monetary policies playing and he a mimbreno don't know how effective you think the chinese authorities have been in terms of the use of of monastery policy to manage the economy should though the the folks at this other people's bank of china should they be talking to soothe pig farmers as well for what it's worth i'm certain they are because that's an important component of inflation its food in particular is a big part of the consumer price index in a sister big part of the disposable income and i think what we've notice with the pio see is that their manager policy framework their formalized open market operations have really stepped up quite meaningly in the last couple of years from officially from november of two thousand and fifteen so monetary policy is now becoming a much better tool and you can monitor that through again the formal open marked operations you can look at it with short and funding costs so this is actually a much better indicator we would say of what the central bank is actually doing rather than just what they're saying and so you can actually start to see over the last couple of years that tightening of monetary policy the easing of monetary policy over two thousand and seventeen and eighteen respectively were very clear to see and that helped us without position it helped to get conviction that helped us to add risk at the end of last year and the other thing that i think very relevant to that it's all very interconnected as you can imagine his oversee the currency and interstate differential we talked about that before but then it's even just look at the credit as to impulse that that credit grows within it within the economy this is critical in assessing and evaluating the cycles in the many cycles that we see within china all very related to each other because manator policies not just credit grows we also need to add things like fiscal impulse or local government but are spending for example and if an if we should have turned to sort of macro prudential measures more broadly george again irritant as asked the same question in i look at it despite lots of different er economies and governments talking about material measures you could argue at she that china been one the most effective at using matter of prudential measures to control the economy am my right in thinking that well last year we have had the delivering campaign and that has been working but at the same time he has also had some unintended consequences and actually that links up very much too towards value the credit circle in the credit so they could it impulse what happened last year was that company's that needed liquidity that needed credit flow the most these esora companies in small and mightie enterprises these companies did not have access any more to lending and as a result we started seeing an increase of defaults of more more spreadeth on shoon market and that's important because small midside enterprises in china are private companies in china they make up a big part of china's employment about seventy to eighty per cent of urban employment and if we think of no china and near the political spectrum in china that he the keys for objective year is i would say social stability how we can relate that to the economy something more tangible than we can monitor and out artha that is employment essentially not seeing an employment rising if private companies are having issues and not issues because they've been poorly managed but issues because they're not finding access to liquidity then that is a bad thing because it can be to rising on employment now that was identified as an untainted in consequence by the market by the by the pubic middle of last year they started stepping up on that front and as a result that for my perspective that was a catalyst to start adding to risk especially in transports in the maker prudential policy that were also seen which i think is a little bit mixed but i think you're write parasites it's been a pretty good example of how it can work it certinly at scale that's for shore clearly we've seen over many years quite extensive policy controls around the property market around lending standards that's actually created some distortions frankly at some and makes result if you will the other macro prudential policies and probably torturing and stretching the term and the definition a little bit it's just really been about the cost of funding so the overall cost of funding the allocation of capital within the economy has been very heavily skewed toward state owned enterprise and with good cause through decades of rapid development this is a necessary a very valid way to create capital degenerate fixes et investment in for structure and everything that goes with it the problem however is overtime if the cost of capital is not price correctly you then get a misalliance ital and one of the nice things that we see about the development of a domestic bond market is that it starts the process of pricing capital better and when you prize capital better you get em much higher chance of that capital being allocated more efficiently and it's not perfect it just means that good quality companies get rewarded with a lower cost of funding and vice versa it's a work in progress the bon market helps you'd do that ah but that's i would argue the number when financial market reformed for china the efficient pricing an allocation of capital and the bonar helps with it but they still a lot more to be done and in no just upon market also in the inclusion of china into of the barkless in this is attra which will slowly find international institution investors on coming to the market and again helping with pricing that risk more efficiently tis on that the iselin of capital point at this time i run of easing a get a very different feeling is you know from the recent like the april depew's immensely commentary you really feel that the statue to tighten the little bed after you know the first carterville of easing so seduced them around that dear mentality is very different in a dooties want to control the liquidity enough to support economy not collapse but they don't answer to really ponderosity was bendel quality and in a great lord of abas or you know and another in another word allocate capitain a very inefficient way so so i think it also calmet and attitude change and towards the easing and endeavor that brings more credit financing to direct our equity finance or bon financing a brand you mention property and traditionally properties were up to seventy per cent of chinese house o wealth is tied up and i calling richard edgar is hit the streets and shanghai to see what's happening in the property market and what that could actually mean for the broader economy paris i'm in down town shanghai the centre of the proudhon business district effect just outside our offices you can probably wave and i see you but i'm about to go in a ramble to see some rather different areas different neighborhoods at the story they tell about china's economy to day my guide is alexeyevitch out of his hearing charlotte had spoken to you what can i shall thank you very much what an exciting time to be covering real estate and i know this you think that shanghai is a little bit like china in miniature if you could call a city like this of twenty six million people in any way many but tell me about the development here in this business district what what we looking at right now sure we are now standing in the very centre flute out a fine shall tell and there are round forty beauties in this area and in those beauties we have over two hundred thousand of people working for the finish industry and thirty years ago what was here fields and somber a shabby a neighbourhood and when the chinese govern desired to develop houdon area esther starting point of the opening up and away start to seal altering some of them up her beauty in the nineteen nineties but also some of them are wood in her to satan so this is possibly there that the scene that most people think of when they make her misfortune anything of with the sing her bets on you're going to take me to a rather different place yes of course a for the resent community in this route azara other two cows one is about sufficed ten minutes walk from our office and the other is round at twenty minutes more foal office and the mate living in the that the twenty minutes came he says that we got some exercise too at to get on with her then whether he lead on he asked why alex not not at awful looper excise if any be walking propylaea seven or eight minutes and here we are in the area that you were telling me of ahem much more residential isle fevers of trees down this sir the street very effective and helpful and a very sunny day hear it sing hi tell me back that the shops of we can see her round as you can see the most popular are cottages restaurants coffee bars the spars and i think all of these represent the fast growing service industry in china so definitely a structure train however we out to sea all of these canons that hun over raised very high turnover or the chair rage which means some honor people trying to open their own shops however some people succeed to to survive for some people just to have the close down just after me be that that a the tannin lee's spirit so that this is your labour if you will happen down this street every day how often you seem uses here ah i have to say very often naturally in front of us these three shafts i didn't didn't found the hum that during the last week and living here and how long how long to ihelos i'm well it depends i see the proud agents robbery could last quire appearances because sir they are to the expert about said the mount and this dumpling shafts i think they mainly served the mitla and customers are she also survived either alive law time but this one which is he stood me kind of shops ah miss quite a specific demand so i'm not quite sure how long the casam so dumplings yes chiefly may be no and how important is prophecy as an investment to people here tea the property prize went off about thirty per cent two fifteenth and another city for saint sixteen but after the two years so skyrocket the shagaunty with intervention the curb palpable light toon seventeen so we stands fifteen per cent japan end the which buttoned february this year and jaafar six per cents easing up sixty cent when left that chet edging off is that i'm has that government intervention and the flowing of the incredible and racing away of a presence and has not changed the way that people think of ants for why definite property has become less attractive as a messenger heart as well he had much edified heavings i thought to my apartments in this area a yard to a sixteen so i enjoy the rally into our sixteen five i also experienced a job until seventy and eighteen what so defiantly i don't feel that as a from me miss my angle i more trees living purpose a i seem the one that the paupers woke up and to control the prop to baba is also prevent the proto too crowding out too much consumption so i think there will even be a structure tramp for the chine household to allocate there sets out of prouty and gradually into other types like equity fixing tom and other have a thing and also on the other hand you have more ham that was what i came we allocated to consumption so that technic good foot captor marthy in consumption for the next decade i say here and the leafy streets is a homicidal think i thank you my mates think there much then robin explore this point that alex raised on consumer transit more that does what he said really chime with your own outlook i think it's quite common to thinking that way ah but from my kind of experience i redfield opposite way i think that you know you have your property prices writhing is executor of wealth effect and increase your offers increase your consumption power in second it also increase our expectation for the future growth so i do think that wealthy fact takes a big part or from the public price of its inner bobby quite good food for the consumption and also you know i do experienced a very big dropping honk on public praise that back into ninety eighty seven when the public price dropt seventy per cent so that devil he gained to decrease in consumption not increase one the things that i discovered sort of meeting chinese companies over over the last year is that it seems as if local brands starting to resina with consumers arguable more than international bands and which were very used to this idea that a international brands like nike have globule residence but but what really surprised me as a prominence and growth and appetite for local brands is this real shift the whistling yea it is a very strong phenomenon emerging and in in the past decade i think that two reasons behind that first the one as you have the local brand is really have their quality improved a items of valor for money it can give you better utility so does fundamental reasons why you know the local pantin emerging and second also from the consumer perspective or we got a young generation dear conception pattern is really different from in my generation on ever the very focus on an tailor maid demand and also very focussing and also the quipos on a kind of interaction of fee back so that sometimes you know the local brands the really good at unite very fast and changing their models and designs the better and tieing the younger generation customers whereas in national brands fiume utica examples like p and g when they want to launch a new product and taint fitting to the younger generation they needs turns off process approval from their pester an irony centre by the local cosmetics of music brands the change in really fast and one of the emerging stories really that was about increasing household leverage on the credit eeriness is its increasing house or boring a concern for you the level of household that is always something we need to be thinking about in any economy a particularly around the rate of change some one's property or properties plural as is often the case within china and the mortgage associated to that is is to be the largest part of that household debt that wealth effect in everything that was talked about is overseen important part of that the good thing is generally speaking we don't see excessive levels of debt in the household sector other than their invests and even then it's been difficult to have excessive amounts of debt within the household sector but as we start to think about things like automaton for example and we start to think about that the use of consumer credit this is a much trickier part of the household the problem as usually at a higher cost of finding its usually brings forward consumption and and of course it's harder for that to sustain a rapid growth and then actually is what brings about sicily within more developed economies like the west for example which is very much domestic driven wet with a large amount of added domestic credit focus and household deat focus i mean the development of chitor credit scoring systems or social scoring systems it is clearly a way to try raining and self regulate if you will but i guess i'm not concerned about household irate at this point of stage but my goodness its its increase quite significantly over the last few years that stiffly something we need to be watching and mindful of one will think to idling up to that is in a monitoring household leverage levels but simultaneously monitoring saving street's levels which historically and continues to be one of the highest globule if that star sitting at a time when household liverage is moving upwards that would be more warring dynamic haven't really seen that yet happening any meaningful way agree with some bryanthus rise never quickly but my feeling it that is to pretty much links to the mortgage some mortgaged dance is still so far the largest part of the a household or leverage so again you know ilinka he question of poterie my view is properly prize is going to be stable not lapsing and as long as is the case i don't think in it's a mortgaged hypotenuse is going to be a big problem whilst thus a really helpful inside if i wanted to bring this all together with what we've really learned to day is that the chinese market at the capital markets are in continuing their process of of opening up already be seen the pace really accelerate over over the last twelve months was already interested to hear that it of view on the management of the economies by the chinese authorities we were giving all a credibility for both the affair efficacy of monetary policy as well as that the maker prudential measures and that whilst we're seeing a maturing at real estate cycle and potentially a kind of a more mixed outlook for real estate that in fact the a the consumption story continues apace and of course we'll be keeping a very close eye on pigs that brings us the end of our show to day i'd like to thank my guests linder and alex and shanghai and brian and george in hong kong the

21.wav,this pot cass is an investment profession was only hello and welcome back to rich pickings with elsie's acid allocation potass i'm richer editor in chief and you join me on a very wet june day here in the city of london i'm sheltering out of the rain or was his wet outside the views we have inside this foothold or anything thus our investment seems have made a significant shift away from risk we discuss why in this episodes plus how the u s china trade war is weighing on their thinking are politicians leading us to economic anicette or will mock heats take it all in their stride listen on to find out her oh oh with me this studio is still this month's acid allocation or when when landrath lead cross acid strategies paris one ahead of acid manager for asia pacific and james bateman our chief investment officer from multi as welcome to you all the well let's start with the usual left field question that reveals the real you this month can you tell me the one thing that you prefer to do the old fashioned way parishes with you thank you richard as both the one thing i prefer to day to do the old fashioned ways reading i never been able to get on board with e readers i also had you prefer hard back books as well and given night i travel a lot means that i'm unnamable carrying out a existed excess baggage perfectly excellent when we have it you i'm going to talk about something a little bit heavy which is moral values on my reading a book called a the road to character by david broken it's about some twentieth century figures on the embody of characteristics that are really centred around civic values and improving society but without seeking celebrity so old fashioned civil er values or for you and james were richard you can never rely on me to take things from the deeper mindful to the shallow and superficial so i would say make cocktails and i could resist the pun excellent sir kay well i'm glad you said it so i didn't have to eat now and let us get to thee an asiatic the house view as agreed across all of the acid classes at when wind take his thought there was some significant moves this time yes a atter acid allocation matang we've decided to go i'm decidedly more risk go off and even though the underlying economic indicators are descents we are concerned about trade war impacts as well as valuations so specifically am inequities for the near term view we've gone from neutral to under weight i'm within government bonds sweet gone from under weigh to overweight in the near term over the medium term view we'd gone from under weight to neutral and then with incorporate credit we've gone from overweight to neutral both in the short term in the medium term so in some this reflects are more a defensive posture given the risks that were facing the son's pretty risk off doesn't it and paris going underwaist equities i am in thee in a short term at least at that quite significant move it is a night you know it put from my perspective it could be looked at in some ways as a position that reenforces a kind of risk of perspective but actually when you think about what is driven markets especially equity markets over the last few months it's really been linked to that dobbs position that the fetus has taken so even if for example you had a more constructive view on the macroom which i which i personally do that if i look at what markets are currently pricing into day which is actually further accommodation from the fate that fails to come through them that in and of itself will be quite bare for market i'm i'm avery supportive of the view from that perspective in a sense that you have not not just if if we we end up in a roscoff in violent but actually if we end up in her inuit ning environment that we don't expect a cat and james we're talking about the house for you and which is made up of us across the other teams across the massic classes as head of multi asset does it reflect your views at the moment a broadly does yes richard so i thinke that the timing and the nuances excited from the maltese so we to to continue my my flippancy we did sell in may rather than june that another that was i get round em timing of meetings but this it is already getting on if you ready gone under way eyots in may and that fetinia arguments that on the one hand the acredale looked so kay and at she could be good but the reality was mark is a good head themselves are we worried rat valuations and were very worried that this soul of trigger of the fed was only can ever be to the downside not to the outside and i'd like to pick up that view that james reflected on on valuations because for me that is one of the common denominator around all of these decisions that we taken so you look at the the house fed hat cane we win is laid out and you can say it it reflects in totality or a risk of position but at she look at the underlying decisions and i think the one thing that supports them all is the fact that we are seeing little value in many of the acid classes across the market so that sir that that that one way of looking at the icy because one things that struck me as that i am thee fly with fidelity leading indicator which comes from your team eh james that's looking remarkably positive now having been in the doldrums for as long as i remember and it's now hurtling into positive he tears social great it is so what we said that is in on one hand look superficially very good and on the other hand the prey two main caveats one is that marinated doesn't drive markets and there's a connection but it said he doesn't drive it and maybe that marcel rations will inter the price markets already on the second issue is almost by definition leading indicators are trying to predict the future and there are reasons why you'd believe it in the reasons why you may have some caution around it and therefore we say that the extent of the positivity of showing at the moment is is probably higher than the reality and when when am the discussions that goes to to this point and what was probably the main threads that you remember from that well we're spending a lot of time analyzing the trade war and i would say that this is something that's not necessarily captured and fly ah in things can happen on such a short notice now with tromp treating about the trade war an escalading the situation on may fifth so this is new information that would it necessarily have been captured in fly but it has huge ramifications for what will happen through that throughout the rest of the year i think you it wouldn't went when we think about positioning we think about of exogenous risks like geologic trader et cetera you have to come over relates back to valuation and harris's point that the when valuations look reasonable that the downside rester to some unexpected news from every trump increasing terrace further some some excurtion there in some worry it's not major way on on ris assets the promise and valuations are looking a bit stretched and the dancer risk is ready quite high and it were in that position the reason were risk of partly as because there are clear binary downside risks that could be quite big on markets given valuation spirits and on one the most interesting things that came out in our discussion we was we should have dissected the shape of markets over the last few months was really the the non follow through in terms of flows so even though mark in action has been very positive we haven't seen the kind of flows towards risk acids that would give you that security that this is something that that didn't so the feel fragile exactly as as james said whether it's its trade war where there is something else that was just that feeling of fragility around the bull market and like a substance of otis well and i space another thing that i am fascinating at the moment is a remarkable turn around in signals from the us federal reserve which until recently was i'm implying that it would be an hike on the horizon and now its indicating it be willing to cut interest rates to offset any damage from those trade wars and ignoring inflation that might be coming from and that the trade was when when i met that this remarkable tenement is not it is at the end of twenty eighteen of the market was pricing on a few heights for at twenty nineteen i may at this point we're looking at tom a total of eighty bases points of of cuts priced into the treasury markets so it spent a very rapid turn round and i would say that this is partly due to the very quick pivots and policy that do come from the very top president trump so the signals around us inflation have been pretty muted ere to date a man the fed is doing some work in terms of how they want to analyze it going forward from a personal perspective i do think that inflation is said to rise because of the tariffs and because of the tight liber conditions but this is a question that is out there in the marquet that people are trying to answer if your surprise i suppose if inflation didn't rise because the prices had been passed on to an american consumers but let's have her a moment to think about the impact of the traders themselves on on economic grace only i speak to you markets research almost in samson he gave a relatively up beat outlook on the impact of this diplomatic dispute more my welcome in an i know that you've been looking into the impact of the betrayed war whether it is a war yet or not between a china and the united states and as long as the impasse of this trade war remains confined to the oursin china you think it won't be the killer blow to to the rest of the world was that while looking at some far estimates of the impacts of even the worst case am scenario it twenty five cent tariffs on all our chinese experts and trying his retaliation we think over the next two years that probably takes off not went two per cent to not point three per cents as from your estate pirot em and clearly more in china perhaps more like seront five per cent or even one percentage points next year and that's meaningful but it's also small enough or manageable enough to other policies so not trade policy but fiscal policy and credit palsy can offset it so if it does come to pass through those er those effects that you've set out how should people try and understand the impact again to have let say on on the ass economy what one good way to think abuse is that the ass consumes about seven half billion barrels of oil are every year that's roughly costs about four ingin eighty billion dollars say that toothill prices a about four eight billion doors is very close to the total minds of imports that the stakes from china so if this is it just to explain it is buying as much oil as it does good and anything else from china so that they're roughly equivalent in a sense yes so if you think about a twenty five per cent shock to the old price that's about fifteen dollars higher in oil and the tariff is is basically a price shock so fifteen dollars her and all it does hit growth certainly as hiram's but it doesn't believe people screaming and that whereby singeth a major recession and so for me thus that's the comparison that i make in my head that we were able to weather am the the ups and downs of all prices and where were come of use to that we should maybe think about i'm terrace in the worst case even in the worst case as an being some similar sort of experience sought a perfect analogy but it's a good stars great so a less damaging to the ass what about data from china was a telling you about it itasca with the effects of a trade war so we have seen or we saw glances are this year a significant loton in chinese data but actually and since about february things as savili to perhaps slightly improved and and most of that slow dine was at your relates to fiscal and credit policy that started from china domestically almost a year ago now if you think i watch it slow disestablished credit policy that'll save you a sense of how much leeway they have to re stimulate the economy to help counteract some the effects of the trade war didn't they will i think we're already seeing in a significantly increased samoset of trina in the first court of this year and given the increased tensions the the chance of that extending you further and has only risen that sir in samson and dim earlier he was saying that the impact of terraces roughly equivalent to oil i have to tell you that sitting here in the studio when wynn was shaking head somewhat you ease degree wise wise that women well i am more pessimistic on um trade war impacts first's oil i think that when oil goes up you have beneficiaries like m p companies and oil producing countries there are periods of time like two thousand six are away toward two thousand twelve three fourteen when oil prices went up and it did not constrain growth on the other hand trade wars i think that most people would agree that the impacts are just broadly negative and there are really any winners only losers in coming out of the tree teaches ister trump thinks he's winning hash the winning her or how little corene to be made you are absolutely right and that this is so important as to consider that in terms of economic impacts a trade tensions to tito financial conditions number one lower business and consumer confidence number two so eventually there has to be a negative impacted in the real economy because of trade tensions paris on in had a fairly rosy views result ive and his analysis and the boat would you think of the greatest risks to that so i think the first risk if i if i pick up on the one to the point of optimism that when were made which is at the rare political winds to be had i actually think that may be the political winds to be had from moods like this are probably less than he will think and certainly lessened than president trump things and an the logic goes as follows is that you throw up in the air the terms of trade between two significant economic blocks and you think that they can be resolved in the kind of time frame that mirrors the type the time frame of the inauguration of the other kind of the launch of the of the issue and then what you will happen though is that when you are thinking about it it's true as astraea it is true of the the china and u s trade war is that the devil is all in the detail and that detail is painstaking detail that takes far longer to a sort of work out so so what might seem like a political when in in the beginning my archie political capital being worn down as you go through the prose as you make the comparison with breaks it and surely if he wanted to see an example of where throwing trade deals up in the air and then hoping against the older sort it out before they fall down here in the okapi sweet shown that that isn't i am as simple as as people think exactly and you can also you can also count the political cost of that too said to the tory ship and in the other point that i would make is that was a thing that the the context that even puts around i am with with the all price that makes a lot of sense that is presuming that your dealing with a relatively bounded problem so you've got that you got an all price you can see the impact on it the issue for markets with something like a trade war is that is very hard for us at this point to bound the problem you can even bound it baking some assumptions about you as first as china but at ye when you think about this as a as a sort of a trade crashing more broadly what about the impact of mexico what about the impact on europe that's the issue for markets as you confounded in the same way and james how are you looking at her this might unfold in terms of impact on corraling i think there is crito down arden and i just not pick up one thing on on the old price which is of course you can presume and with your price that the over the mean to me is ranged round and therefore even it i won you it might be revert the next year the row risk is with with tariffs is you could have a situation whether the current level becomes the low not the high for the next five years and that clevis is economically very consequential but that as paris says moves glibly so so what do we worry about will worry about in a venery risk assets as we talked about but we also worry about specific areas and sectors of what worries us are what could be am impacted by surprise or maybe not surprised terrace so we look may be slightly clever in saying that we can underwent latham for some time am on on the basis was we caught like mos markets and under it let time within that on the basis of concerns about around and terrace in that area were also very short arm european toes and i again reflect the same thesis that the there is and there are other reasons to be short there is one in our view but but from a terra one for it's a very easy pain point in and what we see from trumpets put her have sown first negotiate later which is even very much the opposite of tradition approach witches leave them as a latent threat some point down the line but don't don't so so you could see over night harris burd in place on something that then brings europe a negotiation to be that we were talking here about a terrace almost in isolation we were touched on possible and stimulus from the face or in a market pressing in at four cut what else parasite authorities and due o in china example how lightly would they be to it to step up their attempts to to keep the chinese economy ticking over if this really does begin too were to bite so it or my view is that i see most domestic governments central banks continuing a stim stimuli tary path for their domestic economies which is why i'm more optimistic about the globe maker economic picture at the many of my colleagues and i think that they do this in part because they understand the political and economic costs of pursuing a more nationalistic a gender so it's almost the quid pro quo but i do see the weight of that stimulus as we look forward be much more on turns at the fiscal side than on the monetary side simply because in a monetary policy i think is largely played out as a stimulus and has actually resulted arguable in some of the imbalance that had led to the focus on the nationalistic political attender how does that then play out when you've got government that a pretty much indebted and the world at the moment they're going to have to borrow more i am in order to to fund this sort of fiscal stimulus and that that's where he isn't it when we yes i think that you know we feel that fiscal spending is going to increase from here basically to satisfy a popular sam which has emerged around the world and this is going to elevate that to judy praties and how does that set us up james then so in it perhaps i'm less worried about that the most people i think the reality is that the response of the atropos was not that word thought through incense that it prevented her an even bigger crisis didn't necessary worry about imbues as we talked about and now alluded to this imprimis postcards my biggest concern is social cohesion and the gaping rich and poor and an echo really it's the gap between the upper quarter of the lower court alum in his ear this is there's just been this enormous ambition of when as loses driven part by military police in other things and that this greater than lost decade for individuals are not of individuals in society are these be redressed that hast we done through fiscal policies ioway to do it it seems a very small price to pay to issue more debt to do that i actually think markets would be accommodate and positive on that move done prudently by the rights of the politicians post huger i do an i think look that there is to a couple of points i would make one is that when we think about this a ratio that people quote which is detto g p that is a that has kind of limited explanatory power because you're comparing her a stock which is the the quantum of that with a flow which is which a judy p h if you look at the quantum of debt verses the cost of servicing the dead at the debt service in cost are very low at the moments of the afford ability of of of larger and of a larger vanity that lack could change and we were talking just now about inflation rising as a result of terrace that you're going to see a significant bump a soap got my personal view on this is that because of the conditioning around inflation because of the conditioning of or bon market that both on markets and central banks will be very slow just to pick up on it and am also have this view that it is harder and harder to measure the modern economy and hence the views on inflation the published data on inflation may not give you that accurate picture of what actually happening at prices on the line so i'd like to adan analogy to where we are to day back to the u s in the nineteen twenties thirties and forties the level of inequality in the us right now is akin to what we had in the nineteen twenties that was followed by the election of f dar who introduced the new deal to get people back to work ah and sir what were seeing and from the progressive laught and u s to day as the introduction of the green new deal and if they are like policies ah but ultimately that isn't what solved the problem in the u s of inequality and slow growth et cetera it was world war too i'm so looking at it from a sort of a broader perspective we may be heading for a larger type of reckoning ah it is recognized that inequality is get solved or cured in a way by either war or disease but on a more positive note we also think that a third industrial revolution could get us out of this rat when i rather hope it that rather than the the apocalyptic aversions that cellar referring to there james de do you show this er this concern you see both both you and paris seemed to ben significantly more optimistic in this aconites hard knobs and we not doctor seymour to visit the women so the saloon women's write am an interesting of course is is you the timing of sequences different in the innuendos elected verses the great depression if we you draw the proof or eight were in a different timing sequence there is no good in way from that the large size make events can unequivocally redress balances and in fact in a world where one had a similar impact in lower respects but there are two very simple twenty center examples were that's the case the reality is there are lots of other ways to address balances and i think ina political will to do so and an some actors a cecily favor that some don't but it is politically possible to deal with hat and paris alluded to it harder to measure the economy as ismael it it is a lot easier to measure and understand sentiment and what's making people unhappy and what's creating unrest and i think even that in itself is probably some that we say differs from the past that the rise of twitter ever one having a voice is in inerney in others sarsby wonderful but you can really understand and measure what people's benches are what their concerns er and it's very clear what the problems are now and an inner quality is very very solvable through through effective fiscal policy or is reducible through effective fiscal policy and i think governments are waking up to them on that uplifting thoughts that we move now to m our parlor game of hot cakes and hot potatoes what would you buy like a hot cacama which you drop like a hot potato and let me come to win win first what your hot cakes so i'm going to go long populism in short new liberalism the trades through fetching your pessimistic you on things but hit me with it serve a two trade ideas and on the long ends i would go long populism by going long volatility i'm so going along the vets and decks either through ets or options or simply by de risking once or firebox yes how preciate exactly and in the second is my expectation that in faction in the u s is going to rise a more than people expect on a combination of the tariffs and the quiet tight labor market so am i would go long reader on in tips i'm as a plan inflation and that on the short and i would a play populism in the u s by i'm going short or under weight heather stalks specifically managed carinae and in the uk i would short a basket of uku itis which are obviously a focus of the labour party here i kate if they ear if they come to par ocean's habit you your arm hot kicks soap so i think i'd have a short to medium to a hot cake one sidelong him once the short medium term is gold and anything that reelect the generous risk aversion in markets and that the golden bumper not doing much for some time and the fat eddies both a store of value and an error for investment in panic so armed from that point of view i think i think gold on the other side i do think i'm we have to slightly confront that the reality that anything that is truly green truly an environmental and is light to have men to our performance and and whether that is going to our love of alternatives wind and sole lessing are whether something but more direct in the apt market those who varies medium term ating or you you always cannot ascribe their long term value because and that the world is clearly shifting in that direction so green hot cakes and your hopetoun why it may be hot potato am not necessarily for a garment for reasons though the duke you could bring billy open his oil i'm concerned about all unconcerned begin the acrobats is looking too good and the rameses can be less good and i think supply constraints that were there if we look through the next year are probably lessening and he put the two together and and that feels like a damage directory for oil paris will become to you your hot cake so i got to a oakes this week exactly am both of them contrary in both of them in some ways a line to this view that we are going to move into a phase of official spending and that the world in general is going to perform bateman economically then than consensus so i am i think sterling is undervalued to think it nothing is structurally undivided e verses on the trade waiter paces and certainly against a dollar and also in terms of the u s and i think that there's been this long bitias between growth and value if we have more a impostures spending if we see more a wage inflation domestically in the u s which will i think lead to a better consumption picture in in the medico think any ter be a lot of names in newsboy that he worth come a dusting down and having the look out as a result as your opposite and so i'm i'm sure the dullard term i do think that the canoist needed to and support the infractions bending and and the fiscal spending will will put down the pressure on the dollar and then secondly count more tropically am i do think that on the things that were learning from from reading the newspaper is the risk of a holding illicit positions in iniquity traded vehicles and i i think i did not think that he'd just in case people unaware and the uka were talking a lot about neal whitford and to arm his funds that here i am in trouble moved been gaited to redemptions because i under he's invested a loss in the liquid exactly and i think i weep what we've seen in over the last few years is oppose the popularity of ovidius etrange strait at funds and which offer in an instant liquidated to their holders and but i do think that as you at digging to some of those funds that have been launch there are some that hold actually relatively lower liquid or positions and anna i think that that is an area that i would underling to go so he trouble ahead o k will think if everyone paris and i hope that's given you
