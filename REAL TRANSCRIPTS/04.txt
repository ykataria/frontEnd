Why should I reconsider my allocation to Asia That’s the question Fidelity answers In this podcast we explore the very latest in the investment world in Asia challenge some received wisdom and find out who is putting money where in the region and it might not be what you expect I’m joined here in our Hong Kong studio by two investment directors and experts on the region Luc Froehlich from fixed income and Gary Monaghan who covers equities Welcome to you bothNow we’re recording this just after the announcement of which Chinese mainland listed stocks are to be included in the MSCI flagship emerging markets index that’s a benchmark for over a trillion and a half dollars’ worth of assets Gary is this a game changer for the region as well as for ChinaIt is in that Chinese mainland shares can no longer be ignored I think it’s fair to say that if we if we consider where investors have been putting their money for the last 10 years or even longer than that it’s been very easy to ignore the mainland because it's not in the index Suddenly they move into the index and you can no longer ignore it So in that sense definitely it is a game changer And what it also means for asset manufacturers if you like the likes of Fidelity is that if you haven’t already been looking at A shares you’re going to have to start doing that and it's not an easy task The companies generally report in Mandarin The company reports will be written in Mandarin as well So you need to get your analysts in place in order to do that and it’s not an easy taskWell I’m sure you’ve been brushing up your own Mandarin Gary But nobody is denying that is one of the greatest hurdles to investing in China that the companies are of course reporting in their own native tongue So you’ve got to be able to master that How do we cope with itQuite simply there is no substitute for having people on the ground So we’ve got analysts here in Hong Kong Singapore Shanghai as well who speak the language and go meet the companies face to faceLuc in the fixed income world you must be fed up with the attention that your equities colleagues are getting with all this MSCI A share index excitement but is there a halo effect of raising the profile of investing in the region in all asset classes as a result of all thisWell Richard I’m actually not fed up We have also a little revolution going on Actually a few weeks ago the Bloomberg Barclays index announced that they were also going to include China onshore in their own index So this is causing a little revolution in our bond markets too As Gary mentioned it is definitely attracting more attention toward the onshore market in China The inclusion is going to lead a lot of the benchmark followers which is a large amount of institutional money to direct a bit more attention toward the onshore bond market So we are talking about 5 per cent in this Bloomberg Barclays index 5 per cent for China onshore It’s not very large If you compare this to the size of the China onshore bond market which is about 12 trillion US dollars it’s a drop but it’s a beginningAnd I was going to add to that what we’ve seen in the last 12 months is equities have done a very good marketing job in terms of talking about MSCI including A shares And when we go to meet clients the questions are always directed towards the equity world And it seems to me that it’s often not ignored but not well known that this is happening in the fixed income space as well And that's something which I think is quite important because it's not just equity money coming into the mainland but the fixed income money as well which is probably on the whole a bigger wall of cashHow are their clients changing Who is putting money into China Is that changingOn the fixed income side if you look at the bond market the main players are still institutional money If you look at the overall China onshore bond market overall we have about less than 2 per cent of foreign ownership And if you look at the composition of this ownership it’s mostly institutional clients like central banks sovereign wealth funds The retail investors should come but later onThe message hasn’t reached that far yet Or is it confidence a lack of confidenceIt’s simply a different stage of development of the market You would typically see first the institutional money going there they have more resources to analyse the market and following that the retail investorsYes it’s exactly the same really for the equity space in that the key that unlocked the A share market for investors was Stock Connect And that is really something that institutions can use and it’s not that easy for the retail guy to do that unless they invest in companies like ourselvesAnd thinking about the questions that these institutional clients are asking you both how have they changed over the past couple of yearsMuch more receptive I think to A shares Before it was very easy to ignore because it was never in the benchmark Also you could pretty much say We don’t know the companies very well There’s corporate governance issues… and then you could just ignore the entire market But don’t forget the market itself If you look at Shanghai and Shenzhen they’ve got a market cap of about 75 trillion Compare that to Tokyo which is 68 trillion So the mainland is actually a bigger market than Japan So you can’t ignore it But people were because of the point that they were not in the indexWe see a similar development on the fixed income side I’ve been in Asia for the past seven years and what I would say is we are entering the third phase The first phase was going to Europe meeting some international investors and the question was Why Why would I put my money in Asia and specifically in China A few years after that the question was actually Can you give me a positive argument for me to invest in Asia or in China Because they wanted to convince their investment board to start putting money in China and in Asia And now we are entering the third stage and third stage is How How do I do thatGary let’s talk a little bit more detail now about the MSCI It’s about to push huge companies some still unknown abroad onto the world stage What impact is that going to have on their businessWell first of all you should see more let’s say foreign institutional investors on the shareholder register which can bring some more questions So you tend to get maybe a little bit more activist type investors and particularly a greater focus on ESG which as you know is a key theme at the momentAnd something that management teams perhaps until now have not had to concern themselves withNot so much I mean it is a growing theme globally anyway so it shouldn’t come as a surprise to any company But as you get more international investors on the shareholder register do expect to see a lot more focus on ESG corporate governance and just general questioning around what’s going on with the business and the direction it is headingWhat are they going to do with the money that this investment representsWell hopefully the good companies will get a greater percentage of the cash that comes in Particularly if you think of us as an active manager we can choose the businesses that we invest in So hopefully the better companies get more cash which they can then reinvest in the business at hopefully greater rates of returnOne of the comments that I frequently hear from international investors when I tell them Hey look at this market it’s growing so fast I often hear Well that means the companies are just piling up more debts So actually from a risk point of view this is not a good thing It’s actually not really the case It also has to do with the stage of evolution of the company Most of the companies in Asia in particular in China have been extremely reliant on the banking system using loans to finance their working capital or their expansion Now if you continue evolving becoming more sophisticated you need a larger amount of capital which the bank cannot provide you So you need to go to the capital markets The other thing is that the more sophisticated you become the more diverse you want to your sources of funding to be That’s also a motivation for these companies to come in to the Asian US dollar bond market or international market So it’s not necessarily the same company issuing more debt it’s actually more companies And we see that every month you have a maiden issuer a new name coming on the market It requires a lot of research power but at the same time that’s significantly increasing the diversification potential in our spaceSo if we’re thinking about let’s say away from the very mega cap companies in the A share market do you see them starting to use fixed income markets Because I’m assuming a lot of the smaller companies don’t really have much experience there Are we seeing that happen more and more do you thinkThe challenge that these companies have at the moment is twofold Firstly for smaller companies they tend to be higher risk more in the high yield space and in China onshore there is not yet a high yield market Most of the high yield companies that you’d find are actually fallen angels That’s the first thing The second thing is that at the moment if you see these little names trying to issue on the US dollar bond market they would have to pay a yield that would be so high just to make their offer palatable that it would not make sense for them So it is going to take time for the small guys to come on this marketGary you mentioned active management but I wonder whether the inclusion in an index heralds the decline of active in China because now investors can park their cash in a fund that tracks that index get the exposure and get the diversification for example that China offers but they can do it very cheaplyFirst of all what you have to remember the inclusion at the moment is what they call a 5 per cent inclusion rate So effectively they’re there capping the size of the Chinese stocks to only 5 per cent of their true size And there’s only 234 that are moving into the index There’s about 4000 to 4500 listed companies To be frank a big chunk of those are relatively uninvestable for investors like ourselves because of liquidity constraints and such But there is a lot of companies which are not in the index for a start so active managers can look beyond the boundaries of the index which creates alpha hopefully if you get your stock call rightThis is actually another question that I frequently get Why would I use active management to invest in a market like China onshore I’m very open about the use of passive investment in certain markets highly developed efficient markets it can make a lot of sense especially as a compliment to an active strategy Now if you look at specifically the China onshore bond market one of the big challenges there is to properly assess the credit risk of issuers Onshore they have a different rating system; the local rating agency only use three ratings AAA AA A and effectively it’s only a relatively recent trend where we see differentiation in the credit spreads of the different rating groups So the challenge if you are an international investor and you try to follow those ratings especially if you are doing it passively is you are just going to invest randomly and you don’t know which are the credits the spread of which are going to widen and the ones that are going to tighten So it is really a market where active management makes a lot of senseMuch less diversification in terms of the official rating but your point is that there is diversification in the reality of how companies are being managed and the risk they representAbsolutely It is a normal market but the ratings don’t necessarily reflect this realityIf you’re investing with active management you can choose the company managements you believe are working on your behalf as a shareholder So don’t forget that if you are investing in passive particularly in China where there’s a great deal of state owned enterprises (SOEs) you’re embracing certain risks that maybe you’re not aware of Particularly if a large chunk of your passive market is a state owned enterprise you are investing in companies where you don’t really have a say in what’s going on And the management is generally government driven somewhat and they can be called upon to do national service and sometimes that leads to poor capital allocationSo in other words the company is being asked or told to behave in a way that suits the country rather than shareholdersSo I could be a state owned bank and Luc may be coming up with the best new idea we've ever seen but you happen to be an industry that employs 2 million people and the government may say to me Well you’ve got 500 million dollars you’ve got to give it to Richard because they’re keeping two million people employed whereas really if I'm thinking from a shareholder perspective and future growth I should be giving that money to Luc and then he can create incredible returns and that’s the industry of the future So without really realising it sometimes in passive you’re putting money to companies where you don’t have the greatest control and there can be some misallocation of capitalAnd what about the governance in normal companies that have a normal structure or one that we’re more familiar with perhaps than some state owned enterprises What about the management priorities there Is that different or is there a development that has yet to happen in some of those companiesOne thing when people talk about China and this is actually true for Asia it’s not just a China story people will say Oh corporate governance is poor I think we have to think about what we mean by that Actually quite often particularly when you’re meeting companies that are not the mega caps who’ve already got experience the company will be owned majority by the founder and a couple of his friends let's say and they've never really had to deal with shareholders before So it’s not that they’re cowboys and they’re going to run off with your money and they have fraudulent accounting that’s not true at all It’s just that they haven’t had to deal with the expectations of shareholders That’s not bad corporate governance it’s just inexperienced corporate governanceSo do we engage then with companies like that That’s a large part of what Fidelity investment professionals talk about externally So what are the conversations likeThere’s no other substitute to having your feet on the ground and going to talk to them Whether that’s through the analysts the portfolio management team or quite often for equity capital markets team whose role is corporate engagement to discuss some of the things that we hold dear from our investment perspective And discuss things that we will vote on and talk aboutThat’s a very important point and it’s something that’s sometimes misinterpreted outside of Asia Effectively if you look at large or even small Asian companies the ownership is usually more concentrated It’s usual to have the founder who is the chairman who is the CEO There is nothing really wrong about that But to some extent it also explains the explosion of the bond market in Asia If you look back in 2010 when the European bank started pulling out of Asia we saw a lot of these issuers coming on the market They effectively had to change their mentality show more to investors If you issue a bond and you want to get it rated you need to disclose quite a lot of information like when you list a company This has really helped to improve the governance of the companies that we coverSo these are still emerging There’s some way to go still but a lot of development has already happenedYes I would just be careful with the term emerging because it’s a slightly different topic But one of the things that I usually struggle with investors that are not necessarily familiar with the Asian space is that Asia gets put in the same bucket as emerging markets And it leads people to say Oh Asia is so expensive look at LatAm you get much better yield much better returns etc You are not comparing apples with apples The reality is that when you invest I’ll focus on the fixed income side in Asia you invest in about 16 different marketsAnd some of them are very developedSome of them are highly developed If you look at countries like Hong Kong or Singapore they have a very high level of development If you look at the GDP per capita of Singapore it’s actually higher than the GDP per capita of Germany My point is that it’s a little bit dangerous to talk about emerging because we are talking of a good mix between developed and emerging economiesYou make a really interesting point because people are beginning to shift from emerging market debt to Asia for precisely this sort of reason That you change the risk profile There is the diversification away from other debt markets but you are lowering the risk perhaps that goes along side thatI don’t know if we’re lowering the risk I think there is more awareness for what Asia has to offer Until recently when people were looking at Asia they were mostly looking at the yield that you can get this chase for yield And effectively if you look at the investment that you can make in the bond market in Asia you would get a much higher yield than you get in Europe you would get a similar yield as you get in the US but for lower duration It’s a very attractive proposition just in terms of a risk profile Then people also start looking at the different sectors where you can invest in If you focus on the Asian US dollar bond market it’s a market that has grown by about 20 per cent on an annual basis every year over the past 10 years And this has led also to the emergence of new sectors A few years ago if you wanted to bet on the consumption of gaming you would have had one or two names Now you have a real sector So what people are seeing is not only about yield it’s about diversifying their portfolio into different industriesAnd the types of outcomes that people are looking for has moved on as well Gary Asia isn’t just about growth nowNo There are other factors that we see as being quite interesting within the region For example dividend It often shocks people to think of Asia as a dividend market but if you look in markets like Thailand where the yield currently is around 27 per cent Taiwan where it’s above 35 per cent We’ve got markets as Luc said it’s diversification that offer different things for different types of investors And actually someone was saying to me yesterday that they’d read a study that one of the key drivers for share price return and share price capital growth is an increase in dividend within the Asia region So it’s telling you that there are other factors other than growth But of course to grow your dividend you generally have to grow your business and grow your cash flow So it is linked but there are other factors which we find quite interestingLuc when investors put their money into Asian fixed income what exactly is it that they’re buyingOne point that we’ve touched is this good balance between developed markets and emerging markets I couldn’t stress enough this point Besides this what they’re also buying is diversification lower correlation with other markets We started by talking about the China onshore bond market Again a lot of people are looking at this market because it offers slightly higher yield than other markets But from my point of view what is the main benefit especially in a market where a lot of people talk about stretched valuations are scared about volatility what China onshore is providing you with is an asset class which has close to zero correlation with other asset classes So you tell me what it is better in your portfolio in terms of diversification I think this is really what institutional investors are more and more looking for They go beyond the yield and look at the diversification potentialAnd I think apart from that for a bigger picture type of view buying Asia and particularly the equity market is you’re buying a future New businesses are developing in the region which don't exist anywhere else in the world Tencent is a great example This is a platform through their WeChat platform that has multiple functions that don’t really exist in the west And western companies will look in and say Wow I wish we could do that So you’re investing in the future You’re investing in the future growth as well So just to throw out some stats we’ve got 45 billion people in the region which is about 60 per cent of the global population; 35 per cent of the global GDP Yet that is growing faster than most places in the world So you’re looking at places like Indonesia 5 per cent plus GDP growth China 65 per cent India around 7 per cent growth So that 35 per cent of GDP which should grow over time if we continue to see the current trajectory which we don’t think will slow downThere seems to be no reason to see a change in Europe or the States at the momentWe do expect GDP to continue growing at the rates that we’ve been seeing Yet at the same point in time Asia ex Japan is only 45 per cent of the global equity indexSo there’s an enormous mismatch there I know it’s the same in fixed income as well that the proportions that are allocated to Asia are much smaller than they ought to be on that measure There are perhaps reasons for that though We’re coming to the end so after an inspiring discussion perhaps on the good reasons for investing in Asia what are the things that investors need to watch out for What are the potential downsides Because you can’t just plough inThe traditional risk that is seen in markets like Asia is the higher volatility This is typically what people would tell you that in a period of uncertainty you’re going to see much higher volatility in emerging markets including Asia It’s actually not been the case If you go back to the Brexit referendum vote or the Trump election what we’ve seen actually is that the Asian US dollar bond market especially on the investment grade side has been a safe haven Because you are able to shift money into an environment which is pretty well sheltered from the rest of the world and where your opportunity costs are actually not high at allIt’s an amazing turn of events GaryIt is And alongside that increased volatility I must say that there is generally greater retail participation in some markets which does sort of create more churn And so therefore you can be on the wrong side of that So there’s an element of risk there But also one of the things which I mentioned earlier there’s a lot of state owned enterprises in the region and they are a big chunk of the market and if you are a passive investor in particular you are taking on state owned enterprise risk which is you don’t always know what’s happening with the capital that the company has So there are elements of risk that you have to be aware of Therefore going back to the point of why active that’s one of the key selling points for active in the region is you try and avoid those areas Not all SOEs are bad I want to say that but there is a risk of capital misallocationLuc So we are going hear probably over the next few months if not years about more default in China This is already making the headlines of all or most of the national newspapers The reality the way we see it from on the ground is it’s a positive development It’s a positive development in the sense that it improves the capital allocation The bad companies that are piling up debt who are just doing M&A in an inconsiderate way they are going to be sanctioned The government is stepping away and saying Look investors you need to realise the risk that you are taking So it is beneficial for bourse companies because it helps them allocate capital properly If you’re a good company you should pay less for your funding And it’s good for investors because now when you put your money in the company you know that you’re going to be compensated for the risk that you’re takingSo it’s a more efficient market that is maturing and that brings with it benefitsAnd one other risk to think about is that you are taking on institutional risk and by that I mean that you’re still seeing some developments within the regulatory environment It could even be legal fields in some cases governments Thailand is a great example where we’re going to see some elections the first elections for a number of years next year So there are those risks as well that you’re embracing when you’re looking at the region But again you just need to be very selectiveSo plenty of opportunity but go in with your eyes open is perhaps the best way to summarise it all Let me thank you both Gary Monaghan and Luc Froehlich for joining me
